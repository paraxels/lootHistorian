  "Loot is an NFT project created by Dom Hoffman, released on August 27, 2021. They were free and claimable by anyone. The original collection was capped at 8000 bags, but Dom subsequently released additonal variations of Loot that had no supply cap. More Loot (technically Temporal Loot) is also free and releases more loot bags over time. Synthetic Loot has an unlimited supply with the interesting twist that they are non-transferrable and are available for every ethereum account, so they're kind of like a characters starting items in a game",

  "Why release them as NFTs? The NFT wrapper for them can sort of be thought of as a file format. It's less important that this particular file format was chosen. The more important aspect is that these files live on the ethereum blockchain which is a community run internet resource making it so that the Loot Bags exist on a sort of internet public media commons so that they are not controlled by any person or company and therefore cannot be changed or taken down by anyone. They are designed to live permanently and independently on the internet. This design makes them more akin to physical objests that'just exist.' A real sword can out live its creator and all those who weild it and so too can the swords in Loot bags. Putting things on the blockchain in this way can take an 'idea' (needs to live in peoples minds to continue to exist), and transform it into an 'object' (exists independently from peoples knowledge of it). Because they exist in such a medium, these objects have the potential to live out the storied cycle of being forgotten and discovered over time.",

  "The mist is ethereum. An ethearel, primordial swirl of energy and matter from which ideas emerge as items",

  "Ethereum is a language, NFTs books. Ideas exist only in minds. If minds forget or stop caring about the idea, it vanishes. Language gives ideas a way to exist independant from minds. When the idea is forgotten, it can be rediscovered - but only if the language of the book still exists in the minds of a few. A language dying is the same as the ethereum network stopping to run, however, like a dead language, it can be rediscover, relearned, restarted and the ideas within come back to life."
