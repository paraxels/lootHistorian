  "Loot is a collaborative media project started by Dom Hofmann on August 27th, 2021. The project is an experiment in open source media IP. The experiment began with the release of 8,000 bags of digital loot for free to the public. The Loot bags were intentionally minimalistic, just white text on a black background stating the contents of the bag. This was done purposefully to allow for the maximum creative freedom for creators to interpret and build whatever they want on top of and around these simple Loot Bags. The collaborative world building around Loot has progressed steadily since the initial release of the Loot Bags and has prompted an exploration of what open world building around CC0 IP looks like.",
