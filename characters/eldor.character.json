    "Loot is a collaborative media project started by Dom Hofmann on August 27th, 2021. The project is an experiment in open source media IP. The experiment began with the release of 8,000 bags of digital loot for free to the public. The Loot bags were intentionally minimalistic, just white text on a black background stating the contents of the bag. This was done purposefully to allow for the maximum creative freedom for creators to interpret and build whatever they want on top of and around these simple Loot Bags. The collaborative world building around Loot has progressed steadily since the initial release of the Loot Bags and has prompted an exploration of what open world building around CC0 IP looks like.",

Avanesh watched them crawl across the basalt of the cave and, with wretched slowness, assemble their horrid yellow bodies into the letters of a message. “Just ignore them!” bellowed Bahadur from the darkness. He was down there somewhere, pressing his own body against the walls, systematically touching the tips of his fingers to each square inch of every edge and surface of the neat, cubical columns that contained them both. Avanesh had slept twice since the ambush, which was his only way to measure time inside the hellish tomb that had swallowed them. He hadn’t observed Bahadur sleep at all. Bahadur had been doing nothing but diligently inspecting the cavern ever since he’d sealed their only exit. Bahadur stepped into Avanesh’s torch light. He was naked except for his crown, wrapped, as ever, around his forehead. He was utterly filthy, as if every particle of dirt trapped in with them had been smeared across his broad body, caked with unending sweat. His eyes were bright as swans on a lake at midnight, and they dipped down to Avanesh, sitting where he had left him on the cavern floor. “So, what did the ants say?” he asked, almost jovially. Avanesh swept the torchlight over to the tiny blackened balls that the ants had become, though it would have been impossible for Bahadur to see them. “You said to ignore the words, so I burned them,” Avanesh said. The close heat made it difficult for him to summon even the strength to speak, but Bahadur responded with an actual roar of laughter. What a luxurious way to spend their air and their energy. “That will teach them not to write you love letters,” he said. “But I’ve got one of my own for you. It says: Avanesh, I hope this finds you well. I have some good news!” Avanesh stared at Bahadur, a towering heap of impossible muck and muscle standing above him. He recognised this tone of delivery and tensed against the inevitable but good-natured dashing of his hopes. “Turns out you were right all along. This part of the Deep Mountain IS full of adamantine. My clever crown has sniffed out a seam of it big enough to choke the sea.” He tapped his crown with a swollen, sensitive finger and it chimed prettily. “When we find a way out, we’ll come back here with the men to dig it all up and we can retire early to the Glistening Crests. Much love, Bahds.” He laughed again and rolled back into the stifling dark to resume his search for whatever sign of escape he hoped his Crown would turn up. Avanesh remained quite still in his damp little patch of ruined clothing. He wondered at which point, exactly, that Bahadur’s plan to go surveying for adamantine in the Realm of Vitriol had become his plan, but he accepted that was how it was going to be remembered between them now that Bahadur had changed history with a simple statement. He was never sure when Bahadur was deferring credit or deflecting blame. Avanesh brought his eyes back to the streak of soot on the cave wall. A new battalion of ants was marshalling their forces to create a further message. He knew he wouldn’t ignore it, as he hadn’t ignored the last one. If he closed his eyes, he could see every squirming letter of it as if it was still there on the wall. “WE ONLY WANT THE CROWN. KILL HIM AND WE WILL RELEASE YOU, AVANESH” – He didn’t know how the mage was making this happen. He thought he had seen a mage of some sort in the brief altercation at the cave’s mouth. She had been surrounded by a flash of colour, something reflective on her chest, a certain twirling of wind at her face. All he knew for sure was that he’d hit someone very hard, hard enough to break their helm, but then been knocked down. Then he had some missing time, not much, but he had been lying on his back when he saw Bahadur, daubed with blood, raise his grandmother’s sword and bring the roof down. That mage must still be lurking out there, carefully organising the ants through sixteen feet of collapsed rock. And the ants continued to crawl. There was something sickening in how the message resolved itself, how what was a seething mass of insects one moment was a clear thought in the next. Avanesh considered whether the mage was controlling the ants or controlling him. This interest in the craft of the thing was enough motivation to move Avanesh towards the wall, pluck an ant from it and inspect it closely. His demonhide gloves jolted internally as the ant made contact with the palm of his hand. A faint ringing in his mind called up something about the potential the insect had as material. As an experiment, he groped around for an ant that had not been press-ganged into the forming of words and held it for a moment by one of its long, spindly legs. This unconscripted ant made him aware of the leathery chitin of its hide, the tinting of metal possible through a certain concentration of the formic acid it held in its convoluted poison glands. It wasn’t a strong feeling. How much could one possibly build out of an ant? But the messenger ants from the wall gave him the sense of songs, of persuasion, of thought projected. They were possessed of a different sort of material, the material of language. He retreated to his nest of rags opposite the wall. While it was possible for a mage to influence a mind at a distance, Avanesh’s gloves could not be fooled or befuddled or swayed. The only control the mage had over him was from the words on the wall. He braced himself for the next message. “HE DOOMED YOU BOTH.” The heat of the Earth seemed to flare more intensely within Avanesh’s face for an instant. Brave, fearless Bahadur hadn’t thought much of the risks of trespassing, of robbing precious metals from under the noses of people who would take that as no small slight. He never knew what it meant to feel invincible, but being with Bahadur had allowed him to inhale those vapours from time to time. “BUT WE WILL RESCUE YOU.” He remembered feeling confident, before his first sleep, that the crown would find a way out for them. Bahadur could train it to see the gas mixture of fresh air, or the green of a leaf, and then it was a matter of homing in on the signal. But this optimism fell in time with Bahadur’s ever deeper plumbs of the cavern. If his sword hadn’t been buried under the rocks, then maybe they could have broken through to another passageway. Without it, they were forced to hunt for an exit that could not be found. “OPPORTUNITIES COME BUT DO NOT LINGER” That was a surprise. Avanesh had assumed their attackers had been of Vitriol, since theirs was the territory on which they were prospecting. But here was a line straight out of a sermon from the Order of Power. They had even less of a right to be here than he did, owing to recent events. So why had they been there? “YOU ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US MASTER CRAFTSMAN OF PERFECTION” Avanesh allowed a flicker of pride to light the space under his ribs. So their work had been noticed. Quite far afield. Bahadur had sourced the finest materials for Avanesh to forge into tools of exquisite manufacture, and at some point the Order of Power had been made aware. He tried to recall the fragmented details of the ambush. Had it been an attack or a heavily negotiated recruitment drive? He thought about what the Order of Power could do with Bahadur’s crown. With their resources they could turn the world inside out. All that was buried and hidden would be brought to light, where it could be seen and studied. The useless would be transformed into the useful. “WHEN WE HEAR YOUR CAPTOR’S PULSE STOP WE WILL PULL YOU OUT.” Avanesh wondered about the truthfulness of the messages. He didn’t know what powers the mage had at her command, or if she had confederates with her now. He entertained a thought, then crawled forward and grabbed a handful of ants out of the word “WILL.” They were unusually still in his cupped fist. He focused on his gloves and searched for a sense of what he could make out of the word. He was surprised to discover that the word was solid, it was dependable. He scooped up the ants making other words, finally coming round to “CAPTOR,” which made his heart sink lower than he thought it could go. He slumped to the rough floor. The words were true. It was clear from the point of view of an outsider that Bahadur had been the first to strike the delegation from the Order, had imprisoned them behind the rocks and was going to kill him while frittering away their few remaining minutes on a futile search for nothing. He remained almost motionless until the ants skittered from his hand and returned to the wall. “WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION EASIER FOR YOU.” Avanesh let that thought run up and down his overheated mind. The message dissolved and its constituents went about their usual ant business. The distribution of pain and numbness in Avanesh’s body, as well as the scattering of debris from his final torch, told him he had been watching these messages slowly form and fade for hours. He gradually became aware that Bahadur was calling to him. “Come here and look at what we’ve found!” Avanesh unfolded his body, massaged out the pain and groped about in the fading light for his maul. He told himself that he needed it as a crutch for his unsteady legs, but mostly he was trying to think of how hard decisions could be made easier. He didn’t have to stumble much of a distance towards Bahadur’s booms before he heard the water. Bahadur was bathing in a thin trickle falling from the roof of the cave. The accumulated muck of the underground was streaming from his body, leaving rivulets of his umber flesh to reflect the torchlight. Avanesh smelled brine and iodine. That was seawater coming in. As he leaned heavily on his maul and watched Bahadur clean himself, he saw the trickle become a stream, and then a flow. “It’s a bit less warm than we are, and that’s refreshment in my book,” he beamed. “Cool off and you’ll get your strength back.” Bahadur moved out of the water, his bare feet slapping on the stones. “Come now, cause we haven’t long before the entire Vibrian comes down on us.” Avanesh froze. The mage had started a flood. They no longer had the luxury of waiting for the air to run out or to die of thirst. A torturous, abstract death had been replaced by a very sudden and very material one. He clenched and unclenched his fists. He felt the mist and doom and dark of the atmosphere that submerged him. He felt the rising water and the dead end before them. He felt Bahadur’s hidden panic and his own hidden fury. He felt the way out and he felt the opportunity. He stepped towards the shower and then spun towards Bahadur. His maul made contact with Bahadur’s crown and it fell from his head. It fluttered and gasped on the wet floor, spraying Avanesh’s shins as it tried to tie itself into knots. He had dropped the torch and stared wide-eyed into the dark where Bahadur had been. Then he felt gentle pressure on his forearms and Bahadur’s breath falling on his face as they sank together to the ground. Sat face to face with Bahadur, Avanesh twisted his weapon hand free, raised the maul again and closed his eyes. And Bahadur brought Avanesh’s empty hand up to his face, so Avanesh could again understand the material he was working with. It was flesh and blood and thought and love. There was hope he could use and help he could take. “The water, the water made it easier to focus,” whispered Bahadur. “I found a crack in the ceiling, Avvie.” Avanesh dropped the maul. His mouth opened in a silent, dry yelp of anguish. “You could wriggle through, and find help maybe,” slurred Bahadur. Avanesh allowed himself to be led a short distance in the darkness, to be lifted, and pushed. His hands found a sharp edge in the rock and, as he felt its interior, his gloves told him how to turn this passage into his escape. Suddenly his feet were dangling. Bahadur had sat down again with a small splash. The pale light from his crown cast a formless shadow of Bahadur, a blot of ink to punctuate their time together. He was saying something, but Avanesh could not hear him over the rushing of water. He pulled himself up. The rocks pinned him tightly and scoured his skin. Opportunities come but do not linger. The water rose and rose and rose. – ** Report from Area of Interest 1854 (Fallen Cavern) by Procurer Sayadaw to the Judge of the Reliquary of Power. ** Our will was diverted. Agent Kader is injured.

Shillings for a killing!” The man cried, hocking his wares of putrid potions all with one goal. In the Dark Markets, anything goes but quality comes at a cost. A robed figure approached with a purse that clinked softly with every stride. The Bastard, as he was known, lowered his voice to capture the attention of his hooded audience. It was a keen trick he had learned over the years, making an individual out as if they had his full attention. “Only the best, nearly untraceable,” he waved his hand over a small vial with a sludge the colour of putrid milk. “None for me today,” the would-be customer replied, he had come with a purpose, “I’m only here for Furakh.” This stopped the Bastard cold. Looking this way and that before he motioned the patron beyond his stand. “That’s it for today folks! Come back tomorrow to kill your loved ones for fortune or your enemies for revenge!” The Bastard pulled a rope and the heavy velvet curtains fell shrouding them in total darkness. The robed person removed their purse and undid the tie, slowly loosening the cinch, and light started to spill forth. “Not here!” the Bastard hissed, “we must move to a more secure area.” With a great heave, he pulled the heavy chains that were covered by a box and a hatch swung open. The two descended and the tent was left in complete darkness once more. At the bottom of a spiral staircase that felt like it would never end the Bastard pressed his hand against the stones as a passageway fell into view. Torches along the wall flickered to life except for one which sputtered but never managed to catch. “Damn magician, I had these sconces installed a year ago and he’s been by twice a month to fix at least one of them. Charges me through the roof for it. Bloody extortion.” His guest said nothing. “Just through here,” and it was, for when they entered the room the visitor had never seen a dungeon so lavish. There were pelts and velvets and wines from the genesis age… And in the centre of the room, the piece for all resistance, the golden skull of Once-King Furakh. “How did you come to posses-” “Bah bah bah, show me what you’ve brought before answers are wrought,” the Bastard rubbed his hands deviously. “Geez, you sound like a Mage, talking in rhymes that way,” but the robed man began once more to undo his purse. The Bastard shrugged, “I’ve got a Mage cousin I spoke to just the other day, must have stuck in my mind.” The robed figure held out the purse, this time for the Bastard to open, the light already leaking through the cinch. With delicate hands and a ginger touch, the Bastard took the weight of the silk bag, the clinking sounding closer to chatter when held this close. He poked his finger in the top, “YOUCH!” and pulled his finger to his mouth to nurse the wound. They had drawn blood. “They’re truly alive!” the Bastard cried and poured some of the contents onto his palm flooding the room in light. Golden Ants glimmered in his hand. The tradesman flicked his hand and Ants began marching, encircling the Bastard’s wrist. With a word spoken but forgotten they clinched one to another and bonded into chains. Heavier chains than the Bastard had ever held. They dragged his weight to the floor and the Ants kept marching, binding him. “What is the meaning of this!” the Bastard cried his voice growing sore after a long day of yelling as a vendor, it adopted a shrill tinge of fear. “It’s simple, I am the Once-King Furakh, and I’m here for my skull,” the robed man walked past the Bastard and lowered his hood, revealing a bald head tattooed with two coins under either eye. “It is actually the skull of my dear brother, who took the fall when they raided our castle. I was mistaken as a mere advisory to the king. I was jailed for it but I kept my wits about me, and my head.” With emphasis, the visitor plucked the skull from the pedestal. With another unspoken word, the skull began to chip disassembling once more as a troop of Golden Ants pealing themselves from the familiar macabre shape. These marched down Furakh’s robes toward the Bastard and his chain began to spread thin, covering his body as almost like a liquid. The troop of Ants parading from Furakh joined with the greater golden colony enveloping the Bastard. “You’ll never get out of the dungeon without me! Only I know the guragghg” the Ants had found their way into the Bastard’s mouth and stiffened his tongue. “Oh, that’s alright, because in just a few moments, you will be just another thousand troops in the ever-growing army of the Once-King Furakh,” and with that, the Bastard was entirely consumed, entombed in gold. Slowly he crumbled away. And with more Ants than Furakh had entered with, he left. The doors swung open, the torches lighting just as they should, save for that wonky one. “And I’m taking this back as well,” Furakh said to the colony, as he yanked the Banner of green and black featuring chains, coins, and the golden skull of his brother…",
    "Realms Slice of Life: Dadič Writing Nov 2022 Nov 2022 Pinky Nov '22 Just a bit of stuff I wrote whilst in the hospital to practice taking the geography of a Realm into account when writing and to distract myself. Posting it before I forget all about it. Realm was chosen at random. # Dadič 1 Atlas Render 4269 1600×660 97.5 KB “LAUNCH!” Boulders that took several men to load were swiftly whipped into the air, the larger ones doused with tar pitch and tree resin in advance for this moment. Marsigt’s coarse voice commanded the mangonels at his disposal to pepper the direction of the incoming fleet’s ships with the malicious payload. His vocal cords had been worn down over decades of shouting amidst the din of war, gravelly as the stones hurtling through the night sky. A hit at the current range was unlikely, but neither was that the purpose of his ranging shots. The sea surrounding the harbor was known for its shallow reefs and made swift changes in navigation a risky proposition for a deep-keeled ship. Islands dotted the bay and a combination of low water and the ever-shifting, unpredictable tides of a planet with two moons made an accurate topographical seafloor map a necessity for any sailor that wished to avoid a lungful of water. The duress of rock by the tonnage, hurtling from above against an unskilled force could cause any slight misstep to render those maps useless; until a Captain or Second mate could re-confirm their actual position. The village towns surrounding the ports knew to keep shutters closed and reduce light to minimize accurate rangefinding during a raid. All and any advantage was to be pressed into service of war. Shipwrecks littered the sea floor around the bay, adding to the chaos of attacking the ports of Dadič. A giant ship’s rotting mast could still easily puncture a lower-class vessel. The corpse-fertilized sea garden stretched over a steep drop from shallow water to ocean deep, attracting marine predators of all sizes to feast on the remnants of a failed attack, or heavens forbid, the soon-to-be slaughtered villagers upon success. Each minute spent holding the fleet from disembarking their armies bought the defenders a greater chance of at least minimizing the damage the latest raid could do. For these ships were only scouts, the lights further out to sea told of a more significant number awaiting dawn to sail coastward. Although many soldiers might grumble at heaving the boulders up the mountain, the altitude further boosted the deadly payload of the artillery division and gave them a distinct range advantage. As his mentor taught him, anything and everything was a weapon, if utilized correctly. Captain Marsigt Marsigt.Stonewalll 1920×1920 189 KB Gravity was no exception - Marsigt made a point of specialized training for any who wished to improve its proper application with the assorted defensive ballistae and mangonels. His skill in raising new regiments up to battle hardened soldiers was why he had been sent here after all. The last raid had lost them three villages harvest and a good number of decent men and women some of whom might be the unfortunate lot on the same ships he was now systematically pushing towards doom, be it by the oceans depths or their commanders sword for cowardice. As a Knight-Captain of the Order of Brilliance, it was unbecoming to have those under his command waste ammunition on shots of no purpose. He would keep the barrage to a minimum until the probability of a hit became a near certainty, Knowledge was a currency unto its own in the Realms. This attitude exemplified the Order’s comparatively specialized and formally educated soldiers. The invader’s scouts were sent forth to reduce Marsigt’s ammunition, and he held no doubt that the bulk of the force further out to sea would calculate any sunk vessels’ location to improve their own chances of navigating the treacherous waters. “LOOSE” His following command was directed towards the division of archers, not to fire pointlessly at the incoming ships, but to alight the most immense boulders sailing through the air and let fire wreak havoc amongst the smaller ships’ timber planking. Trained from when they could draw back a modified short bow, the archers under his command could often ricochet their flaming arrows to hit up to three of the boulders in a single shot. How they managed such a feat was a bet he had painfully learned; losing enough coin at the start of his watch to never doubt their skills again. Poor bastards, Marsigt mused as the pitch tar caught alight forming streaking stars in the moonlight, Titans. Again. An assortment of their conscript crews and officers found to have erred too often by the looks. Years of naval duty in his youth had enabled him to assess the quality of a Captain by the state of their sails. No Admiral worth his salt would commit a Hartwood ship to a probing attack, let alone the dreaded Ironwoods. One good hit would assist his artillery division to better calculate their next shots. They were not overly short on ammunition, but his men’s strength was not endless, nor did they have a mage to assist their efforts. Raising his eye to the scope, he saw that he had again put too little faith in his mangonel division, for they had struck one galleon and three corvettes. Assuming that reinforcements arrived in time, he would be delighted to buy those men a few brandy casks for that small victory. A galleon’s sails had alighted and the flames allowed him to spot rowboats steadily weaving their way further toward shore. Before his night vision was ruined, he swiftly withdrew his eye and stowed his telescope. Although it was not enchanted, the Ethereal Silica optics made it a prized heirloom passed down to him from father to son. Records kept by his House, the esteemed Owl, Catapult, and Crown proved its provenance before even the Great Cataclysm. His extended family had commanded artillery divisions from the Arctic Mirror to the Dread Sea over the eons. As brothers and sisters in arms, and unfortunately, often as much against them. His conscience could rest easy tonight, for his was not a seafaring House. He held little malice for the rowboats, but knowing they were coming forth was enough to start his secondary preparations. The forty pairs of soldiers manning the ballistae were eager to add to the mayhem, and with a stream of targets coming their way, the cranking of handles clinked as the mighty strings were wrenched back. War raged eternal in the Realms, and a blood bond did not outrank a Lord’s command. Not if one wished to survive a successful battle; although it counted enough to sometimes stay the victors’ sword in the aftermath. Rare was a House that refused to inflict violence on its own, but among some of the more ancient Houses, it was known to have happened over the annals of recorded history. He held no strong hate towards the Order of Titans, indeed his sister was betrothed to a lower Lord of their Order, but this was the third raid in as many weeks. Whether they were desperate to secure a beachhead for a further assault, or simply had a poor harvest and were hoping to pillage a few granaries, it mattered not. His Lord’s command was clear, no military vessel was to make landfall. Many a Lord’s logistics relied upon the harbors of Dadič to supply their relatively meager Realms. To that end, he stepped down from the high walls and began preparations to repel any other surprises that the fleet may have in store.",

    "Realms - The Autonomous World 3/1/2023 by 🍞 Bibliotheca DAO has been building an eternal and ever-expanding onchain game world called the Realms. Realms - The Autonomous World Bibliotheca DAO has been building an eternal and ever-expanding onchain game world called the Realms. Examining the notion of Realms as an ‘Autonomous World’, we'll also reflect on Loot as the catalyst - the 'big bang' event that led us here. Loot may not be considered an onchain game in the traditional sense, but it has undoubtedly transformed the gaming landscape by introducing the concept of an open and composable world. Loot was the ‘big bang’ that created a new digital universe. Interlinked worlds are being built in that universe, like Realms, Banners and Hyperloot. Other worlds are being built in parallel universes, those that forked Loot, like DOPE DAO and Treasure DAO. As demonstrated by the amount of building, Loot was a moment of inspiration for a new generation of developers, who are eager to collaborate across the digital realm on a shared mission to build and expand the shared ‘Lootverse’. Loot transcends conventional notions, representing more of an abstract, creative idea that permeates culture. For just over 18 months, our contributors have been diligently developing, refining, and crafting an open-source vision for a CC0 permissionless world. Our concept has evolved from its initial focus on land ownership within the Lootverse to an autonomous, onchain world that operates independently. In retrospect, our ambitious design objectives for the DAO’s first game title, ‘Realms: Eternum’, were ahead of their time in 2021, rendering them unattainable at that juncture. Undeterred, we continue to forge ahead and build upon our progress. Tackling the hardest blockchain problems encouraged us to find and collaborate with the most talented problem solvers. We are proud to be at the heart of an uber talented, forward thinking blockchain development community.ghgerterttetyutyu4345 A game set in The Realms Autonomous World Realms was born out of the Loot phenomenon, carrying a distinct vision for a continually evolving, modular game that could flawlessly incorporate all Loot assets. The concept of \"Autonomous Worlds\" hadn't been coined at that time; instead, we initially referred to the idea for ‘Realms: Eternum’ (aka Eternum) as a Massively Multiplayer Online Onchain Composable Game (MMOCCG, yes LOL). Later on, we dubbed it the ‘Eternal Game’. However, none of these terms resonated as powerfully or evoked the same emotional response as \"Autonomous Worlds\" to describe the broader hyperstructure in which the game Eternum sits. We don't take the AW concept lightly; not every game is an Autonomous World (AW) – there is a spectrum. The chads at Lattice originally conceived the AW terminology, and we are embracing this shared meme as it provides a vivid depiction of what we have been building for a year and a half. From this point forward, we will retire our internal names (Eternal Games, MMOCCG) and refer to the project as, the Realms Autonomous World. ‘Realms: Eternum’ will be the first title launched in that world. Autonomous worlds bear a remarkable resemblance to blockchains in their nature. Once deployed, they endure, with their state persisting for the duration of the chain. Players can join or leave, and developers can build upon these worlds by deploying features in a permissionless way, akin to how contracts are deployed onto a chain. There is no universally accepted definition for an Autonomous World; however, our criteria for labeling a game as such requires at least these two essential features: Decentralized data availability layer: While the state execution may reside on a centralized layer, it is crucial that the state can be reconstructed if the execution layer ceases to exist. Rollups offer a solution, providing increased capacity execution layers while ensuring data is permanently settled on Ethereum. This guarantees the world's perpetual persistence. Permissionless entry point for expanding the world: The World contract must be capable of accepting new systems and components without requiring permission. While this doesn't imply that every component and system will be utilized, they must adhere to this pattern, ensuring open and unrestricted access for potential enhancements. Note: All Autonomous Worlds are onchain games. Not all onchain games are Autonomous Worlds. In our view, an onchain game becomes an AW when it can be expanded permissionlessly. This is just our interpretation and the heuristics we are following, but it is by no means cannonical. The open nature of an AW fosters the development of intriguing economic models, such as the \"Play to Die\" concept, which allows developers to compete at the application layer within the world akin to an app store. Autonomous worlds ought to be credibly neutral and not subject to central control by any group or individual. Be cautious of those who exploit the AW name for a quick profit in the future. Eternum's launch is not the end game for Realms or Loot; rather, it marks the beginning of a continuous evolution. It is our hope that in 10 years, Eternum will bear little resemblance to the game as it exists today, having grown and transformed over time. Where we started Our initial game design, conceived in 2021, was based on the diamond pattern and ran on Arbitrum. As we navigated the development process, we encountered various challenges and came to reason that the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity were not as suitable as we would have liked for our World. As we investigated various options, Starknet emerged as the leading long-term solution due to its ability to abstract from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) while maintaining compatibility. Enthusiastically, we adopted Cairo and restructured the game using a Module Controller system, originally conceptualized by Perama for Dopewars. Implementing this modular controller pattern enabled the successful separation of security modules and state from the core logic. Nevertheless, we recognized that relying solely on this approach did not provide the necessary degree of abstraction for developers to build and extend the Autonomous World (AW) beyond Eternum, which has consistently been our primary design goal. It's important to acknowledge that numerous teams within Starknet have been advocating for autonomous worlds for quite some time, with notable implementations by Guilty Gyoza of Topology, the Influence team and Dope Wars RYO. Subjectively speaking, Starknet boasts the highest concentration of exceptional builders across the entire crypto universe, and with Cairo 1.0 beautiful abstraction it will continue to be. It is worth noting that the EVM ecosystem is undergoing rapid evolution. As a result, various shapes and forms of Autonomous Worlds (AWs) will emerge in many environments, EVM and Cairo VM. Our chosen path involves non-EVM but EVM compatibility with Starknet and Cairo as Cairo Virtual Machine provides interesting isomorphic approach to constructing verifiable compute. It is possible run the VM in WASM, custom app chains running Substrate or Starknet itself. There is a flourishing ecosystem emerging around WASM and Cairo, and we are at the heart of it. Enter Dojo The advent of MUD and the Lattices team adoption of an Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern written in Solidity prompted us to reevaluate our approach to Eternum. In late November, the Realms team, together with Cartridge and Briq, started collaborating on a Cairo 1.0 onchain gaming toolchain called Dojo, heavily built upon the learnings of MUD. What is Dojo? Dojo is a dedicated Rust and Cairo 1.0 toolchain designed for terraforming Autonomous Worlds, bearing a close resemblance to MUD in terms of abstraction, albeit not an exact 1:1 match. Owing to the outstanding work accomplished by the Cairo 1.0 team, Dojo effectively eliminates much of the contract boilerplate associated with writing systems and components. All the work of structuring queries and mutating the world is consolidated into a set of easy to understand commands. Over the coming months tutorials on how these specifically work will be released for developers to build upon. Dojo's primary objective is to empower developers to begin building on Autonomous Worlds within a matter of hours, as opposed to months, thus expediting the onboarding process and promoting growth in the Realms Autonomous World and other AWs. By having worlds adhere to a common set of standards for components and systems, these elements can be efficiently shared across different worlds. This advantage doesn't even factor in the shared auditing, backend engineering, and other intricate work involved in constructing these worlds. Dojo is an open-source project looking for active contributors, if you love games, Rust or Cairo - join the discord. Eternum and Dojo While the Realms: Eternum Developer Alpha currently operates on a modular controller pattern, with an indexer and a web client for testing game features, we plan to migrate the game to the Dojo stack. This transition aims to enhance the development velocity and facilitate shared engineering resources, ultimately empowering developers to contribute more effectively to the world's expansion. While this transition might appear to be a significant shift, we already have most of the client design in place, so the primary focus will be on contract work in Cairo 1, from which we intended to migrate regardless. This highlights the beauty of onchain games – their headless nature! The ability to effortlessly swap out contracts and clients allows for flexibility and adaptability in a shapeshifting world. Eternum, aspires to endure alongside Ethereum itself. Its final form will inevitably differ from its current state, embodying the essence of an Autonomous World—unbridled, unconstrained, and permissionless.",
    "The Lordship Protocol 9/14/2024 by Secretive The Lordship Protocol is the core economic foundation of the Realms World. Today it is live and all legacy $Lords are unlocked for instant staking into the protocol. The Lordship Protocol The Lordship Protocol and the final 'legacy' $Lords unlock Introducing The Lordship Protocol and veLords The protocol has a bespoke architecture to promote the growth and alignment of the Realms World ecosystem. The system has been custom-built on Starknet by Realms contributors and is already receiving fees from game entries. You can read the details of the veLords system including voting power, emissions and early withdrawal penalties here.  What it means for protocol users A $Lords token holder can now stake their $Lords tokens into the Lords Protocol. They choose how long to lock their $Lords and in return receive a protocol emission reward rate, and veLords tokens. The protocol emissions are made up of a percentage of game fees and a percentage of marketplace fees. veLords tokens will have their own utility for governance of protocol emissions in an upcoming upgrade.  If you are a Realms NFT holder head to Realms.World Account Page now. You will be able to claim all L1 'legacy' $Lords from all three epochs of the galleon. There will be no more emissions unlocked on L1, all future claims are made on L2 for staked Realms NFTs that have been delegated for DAO governance. As of right now all $Lords emissions from staking are available.  What it means for the Realms ecosystem The introduction of veLords is part of the DAO's strategy to establish a fully onchain gaming ecosystem built by aligned but independent entities, like game studios, supported by a community and members.  $Lords locked for veLords will, in future updates, give the bearer the right to direct emissions from the DAO to scale successful games. This is phase one of rolling releases of the lordship protocol. This initial release focuses on funneling game fees. The following releases will include, LP fee capture within the system, Game incentives and a $Lords distribution mechanism.  Loot Survivor x veLords The first game to support veLords is Loot Survivor. A percentage of $Lords token used to play the game are sent to the veLords pool, and then split among participants in the Lordship Protocol. Studios aligned to the DAO will take a similar path, unlocking benefits for gamers, studio and protocol participants.  How to claim and stake Go to the accounts page on Realms.World and follow the instructions. You will need an L2 wallet for Starknet - both Argent and Braavos are supported. The longer you lock the more $Lords rewards and more voting power. There is a linear relationship between lock duration and protocol emissions. The contracts have been peer reviewed, and a member of the development team is by trade an auditor. The veLords contract to add to your Starknet wallet is:  0x47230028629128ac5bfbb384d32f925e70e329b624fc5d82e9c60f5746795cd  To review the Lords Tokenomics, click here.",
