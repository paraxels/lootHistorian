    "Loot is an NFT project created by Dom Hoffman, released on August 27, 2021. They were free and claimable by anyone. The original collection was capped at 8000 bags, but Dom subsequently released additonal variations of Loot that had no supply cap. More Loot (technically Temporal Loot) is also free and releases more loot bags over time. Synthetic Loot has an unlimited supply with the interesting twist that they are non-transferrable and are available for every ethereum account, so they're kind of like a characters starting items in a game",

    "Why release them as NFTs? The NFT wrapper for them can sort of be thought of as a file format. It's less important that this particular file format was chosen. The more important aspect is that these files live on the ethereum blockchain which is a community run internet resource making it so that the Loot Bags exist on a sort of internet public media commons so that they are not controlled by any person or company and therefore cannot be changed or taken down by anyone. They are designed to live permanently and independently on the internet. This design makes them more akin to physical objests that'just exist.' A real sword can out live its creator and all those who weild it and so too can the swords in Loot bags. Putting things on the blockchain in this way can take an 'idea' (needs to live in peoples minds to continue to exist), and transform it into an 'object' (exists independently from peoples knowledge of it). Because they exist in such a medium, these objects have the potential to live out the storied cycle of being forgotten and discovered over time.",

    "Loot is a collaborative media project started by Dom Hofmann on August 27th, 2021. The project is an experiment in open source media IP. The experiment began with the release of 8,000 bags of digital loot for free to the public. The Loot bags were intentionally minimalistic, just white text on a black background stating the contents of the bag. This was done purposefully to allow for the maximum creative freedom for creators to interpret and build whatever they want on top of and around these simple Loot Bags. The collaborative world building around Loot has progressed steadily since the initial release of the Loot Bags and has prompted an exploration of what open world building around CC0 IP looks like.",

Avanesh watched them crawl across the basalt of the cave and, with wretched slowness, assemble their horrid yellow bodies into the letters of a message. /Just ignore them!” bellowed Bahadur from the darkness. He was down there somewhere, pressing his own body against the walls, systematically touching the tips of his fingers to each square inch of every edge and surface of the neat, cubical columns that contained them both. Avanesh had slept twice since the ambush, which was his only way to measure time inside the hellish tomb that had swallowed them. He hadn’t observed Bahadur sleep at all. Bahadur had been doing nothing but diligently inspecting the cavern ever since he’d sealed their only exit. Bahadur stepped into Avanesh’s torch light. He was naked except for his crown, wrapped, as ever, around his forehead. He was utterly filthy, as if every particle of dirt trapped in with them had been smeared across his broad body, caked with unending sweat. His eyes were bright as swans on a lake at midnight, and they dipped down to Avanesh, sitting where he had left him on the cavern floor. “So, what did the ants say?” he asked, almost jovially. Avanesh swept the torchlight over to the tiny blackened balls that the ants had become, though it would have been impossible for Bahadur to see them. “You said to ignore the words, so I burned them,” Avanesh said. The close heat made it difficult for him to summon even the strength to speak, but Bahadur responded with an actual roar of laughter. What a luxurious way to spend their air and their energy. “That will teach them not to write you love letters,” he said. “But I’ve got one of my own for you. It says: Avanesh, I hope this finds you well. I have some good news!” Avanesh stared at Bahadur, a towering heap of impossible muck and muscle standing above him. He recognised this tone of delivery and tensed against the inevitable but good-natured dashing of his hopes. “Turns out you were right all along. This part of the Deep Mountain IS full of adamantine. My clever crown has sniffed out a seam of it big enough to choke the sea.” He tapped his crown with a swollen, sensitive finger and it chimed prettily. “When we find a way out, we’ll come back here with the men to dig it all up and we can retire early to the Glistening Crests. Much love, Bahds.” He laughed again and rolled back into the stifling dark to resume his search for whatever sign of escape he hoped his Crown would turn up. Avanesh remained quite still in his damp little patch of ruined clothing. He wondered at which point, exactly, that Bahadur’s plan to go surveying for adamantine in the Realm of Vitriol had become his plan, but he accepted that was how it was going to be remembered between them now that Bahadur had changed history with a simple statement. He was never sure when Bahadur was deferring credit or deflecting blame. Avanesh brought his eyes back to the streak of soot on the cave wall. A new battalion of ants was marshalling their forces to create a further message. He knew he wouldn’t ignore it, as he hadn’t ignored the last one. If he closed his eyes, he could see every squirming letter of it as if it was still there on the wall. “WE ONLY WANT THE CROWN. KILL HIM AND WE WILL RELEASE YOU, AVANESH” – He didn’t know how the mage was making this happen. He thought he had seen a mage of some sort in the brief altercation at the cave’s mouth. She had been surrounded by a flash of colour, something reflective on her chest, a certain twirling of wind at her face. All he knew for sure was that he’d hit someone very hard, hard enough to break their helm, but then been knocked down. Then he had some missing time, not much, but he had been lying on his back when he saw Bahadur, daubed with blood, raise his grandmother’s sword and bring the roof down. That mage must still be lurking out there, carefully organising the ants through sixteen feet of collapsed rock. And the ants continued to crawl. There was something sickening in how the message resolved itself, how what was a seething mass of insects one moment was a clear thought in the next. Avanesh considered whether the mage was controlling the ants or controlling him. This interest in the craft of the thing was enough motivation to move Avanesh towards the wall, pluck an ant from it and inspect it closely. His demonhide gloves jolted internally as the ant made contact with the palm of his hand. A faint ringing in his mind called up something about the potential the insect had as material. As an experiment, he groped around for an ant that had not been press-ganged into the forming of words and held it for a moment by one of its long, spindly legs. This unconscripted ant made him aware of the leathery chitin of its hide, the tinting of metal possible through a certain concentration of the formic acid it held in its convoluted poison glands. It wasn’t a strong feeling. How much could one possibly build out of an ant? But the messenger ants from the wall gave him the sense of songs, of persuasion, of thought projected. They were possessed of a different sort of material, the material of language. He retreated to his nest of rags opposite the wall. While it was possible for a mage to influence a mind at a distance, Avanesh’s gloves could not be fooled or befuddled or swayed. The only control the mage had over him was from the words on the wall. He braced himself for the next message. “HE DOOMED YOU BOTH.” The heat of the Earth seemed to flare more intensely within Avanesh’s face for an instant. Brave, fearless Bahadur hadn’t thought much of the risks of trespassing, of robbing precious metals from under the noses of people who would take that as no small slight. He never knew what it meant to feel invincible, but being with Bahadur had allowed him to inhale those vapours from time to time. “BUT WE WILL RESCUE YOU.” He remembered feeling confident, before his first sleep, that the crown would find a way out for them. Bahadur could train it to see the gas mixture of fresh air, or the green of a leaf, and then it was a matter of homing in on the signal. But this optimism fell in time with Bahadur’s ever deeper plumbs of the cavern. If his sword hadn’t been buried under the rocks, then maybe they could have broken through to another passageway. Without it, they were forced to hunt for an exit that could not be found. “OPPORTUNITIES COME BUT DO NOT LINGER” That was a surprise. Avanesh had assumed their attackers had been of Vitriol, since theirs was the territory on which they were prospecting. But here was a line straight out of a sermon from the Order of Power. They had even less of a right to be here than he did, owing to recent events. So why had they been there? “YOU ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US MASTER CRAFTSMAN OF PERFECTION” Avanesh allowed a flicker of pride to light the space under his ribs. So their work had been noticed. Quite far afield. Bahadur had sourced the finest materials for Avanesh to forge into tools of exquisite manufacture, and at some point the Order of Power had been made aware. He tried to recall the fragmented details of the ambush. Had it been an attack or a heavily negotiated recruitment drive? He thought about what the Order of Power could do with Bahadur’s crown. With their resources they could turn the world inside out. All that was buried and hidden would be brought to light, where it could be seen and studied. The useless would be transformed into the useful. “WHEN WE HEAR YOUR CAPTOR’S PULSE STOP WE WILL PULL YOU OUT.” Avanesh wondered about the truthfulness of the messages. He didn’t know what powers the mage had at her command, or if she had confederates with her now. He entertained a thought, then crawled forward and grabbed a handful of ants out of the word “WILL.” They were unusually still in his cupped fist. He focused on his gloves and searched for a sense of what he could make out of the word. He was surprised to discover that the word was solid, it was dependable. He scooped up the ants making other words, finally coming round to “CAPTOR,” which made his heart sink lower than he thought it could go. He slumped to the rough floor. The words were true. It was clear from the point of view of an outsider that Bahadur had been the first to strike the delegation from the Order, had imprisoned them behind the rocks and was going to kill him while frittering away their few remaining minutes on a futile search for nothing. He remained almost motionless until the ants skittered from his hand and returned to the wall. “WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION EASIER FOR YOU.” Avanesh let that thought run up and down his overheated mind. The message dissolved and its constituents went about their usual ant business. The distribution of pain and numbness in Avanesh’s body, as well as the scattering of debris from his final torch, told him he had been watching these messages slowly form and fade for hours. He gradually became aware that Bahadur was calling to him. “Come here and look at what we’ve found!” Avanesh unfolded his body, massaged out the pain and groped about in the fading light for his maul. He told himself that he needed it as a crutch for his unsteady legs, but mostly he was trying to think of how hard decisions could be made easier. He didn’t have to stumble much of a distance towards Bahadur’s booms before he heard the water. Bahadur was bathing in a thin trickle falling from the roof of the cave. The accumulated muck of the underground was streaming from his body, leaving rivulets of his umber flesh to reflect the torchlight. Avanesh smelled brine and iodine. That was seawater coming in. As he leaned heavily on his maul and watched Bahadur clean himself, he saw the trickle become a stream, and then a flow. “It’s a bit less warm than we are, and that’s refreshment in my book,” he beamed. “Cool off and you’ll get your strength back.” Bahadur moved out of the water, his bare feet slapping on the stones. “Come now, cause we haven’t long before the entire Vibrian comes down on us.” Avanesh froze. The mage had started a flood. They no longer had the luxury of waiting for the air to run out or to die of thirst. A torturous, abstract death had been replaced by a very sudden and very material one. He clenched and unclenched his fists. He felt the mist and doom and dark of the atmosphere that submerged him. He felt the rising water and the dead end before them. He felt Bahadur’s hidden panic and his own hidden fury. He felt the way out and he felt the opportunity. He stepped towards the shower and then spun towards Bahadur. His maul made contact with Bahadur’s crown and it fell from his head. It fluttered and gasped on the wet floor, spraying Avanesh’s shins as it tried to tie itself into knots. He had dropped the torch and stared wide-eyed into the dark where Bahadur had been. Then he felt gentle pressure on his forearms and Bahadur’s breath falling on his face as they sank together to the ground. Sat face to face with Bahadur, Avanesh twisted his weapon hand free, raised the maul again and closed his eyes. And Bahadur brought Avanesh’s empty hand up to his face, so Avanesh could again understand the material he was working with. It was flesh and blood and thought and love. There was hope he could use and help he could take. “The water, the water made it easier to focus,” whispered Bahadur. “I found a crack in the ceiling, Avvie.” Avanesh dropped the maul. His mouth opened in a silent, dry yelp of anguish. “You could wriggle through, and find help maybe,” slurred Bahadur. Avanesh allowed himself to be led a short distance in the darkness, to be lifted, and pushed. His hands found a sharp edge in the rock and, as he felt its interior, his gloves told him how to turn this passage into his escape. Suddenly his feet were dangling. Bahadur had sat down again with a small splash. The pale light from his crown cast a formless shadow of Bahadur, a blot of ink to punctuate their time together. He was saying something, but Avanesh could not hear him over the rushing of water. He pulled himself up. The rocks pinned him tightly and scoured his skin. Opportunities come but do not linger. The water rose and rose and rose. – ** Report from Area of Interest 1854 (Fallen Cavern) by Procurer Sayadaw to the Judge of the Reliquary of Power. ** Our will was diverted. Agent Kader is injured.

Neither reaction was of any interest to the homunculus, which turned its back to the useless warrior and zipped away down the heavy corridors of the hospital.\r\n\r\nSayadaw wanted to snatch the foul little animalcule from flight and stamp it underfoot, though she understood perfectly well that this would lead to an outcome more certain than suicide. So she allowed it to flit by her face and to return intact to its host, the Judge of the Reliquary of Power. She instead channelled her urge to violence towards her face, where it shone from her eyes.\r\n\r\nKader folded under Sayadaw\u2019s bifurcated glare. The one visible eye was terrible enough, but Kader could see an extraordinary pulsating of sickly colour refracted through Sayadaw\u2019s eyepiece. She hung her head, which would not stop ringing. She felt like she would vomit again, though her stomach was empty.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Procurer Sayadaw,\u201D she said, \u201CYou needed me.\u201D she said.\r\n\u201CI needed your shoes,\u201D hissed the mage, and stamped off to her transport.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nAfter being carried back to Kezkiisch Library, Sayadaw found that she was in a better mood. The rhythm and noise of the ride had allowed her mind to unspool and her thoughts to reweave. She watched the smog-covered buildings of her home rattle by, and when she closed one eye she saw the dull and frightened colours of the people walking by, the dance of the sky to the rays of the setting sun. Somewhere between the hospital and the Library, her view of the situation in which she found herself had been cleared.\r\n\r\nShe could no longer use Kader, or her Boots, even though she had made it clear to the Judge that these were instrumental to her goal. Kader would likely be sent to whatever knacker\u2019s yard they reserved for broken warriors and her Boots were under containment at the hospital waiting for the jurats to spirit them away. Sayadaw knew that even if she were defiant enough to steal them without being seen, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to use them in any meaningful way. Kader had been trained well in their operation and when she wore them she could walk through solid rock as if it was sand. Sayadaw imagined that, were she to don the Boots, she would drown in the ground before she was able to put one foot in front of another. No, the Judge\u2019s beastly little creature had ended that entire line of action. She had to find another way to enter the collapsed cave and collect her prizes.\r\n\r\nFor Procurer Sayadaw had spent the last eight months with her very keen eye fixed to two objects of her fancy. She had chosen them carefully, being useful enough that the Reliquary would open its purse-strings to aid their recovery, but obscure enough that she could claim a grant for their personal use without competition. She was pursuing Victory Bite, a Crown that could find things, and a pair of Gloves named Tempest Bender, that could make things. They had been in the possession of a couple, both of whom were scurrying up and down the Vibrian Coast inexpertly seeking their fortune. Wherever they went, she had paid to loosen tongues and sent her friends in the Order of Vitriol to make inquiries. When she had at last received intelligence that the pair were on their way to explore a deep network of caverns in Haukpiukpipi, she acted quickly. The caves were a short journey from her base at the Library, so she activated Kader, who was supposed to be a warrior without peer, and bustled out on the next wind to catch the treasure-hunters unaware. Time was of the essence, as the Archivists of the Scrollhouse were also interested in the activities of this couple, which were taking place almost on their doorstep. Her supervisors at the Reliquary and the Masters of the Archive were locked in a long-running game of acquisitions which had been accelerating in the past year. Both powers were sending their agents further and deeper into the Realms in their hope of gobbling up all of the world\u2019s inexplicable and magical items. These agents were coming into open conflict with each other more often. Sayadaw\u2019s background in the realms south of the Archive had served her well, allowing her to snatch precious things from right under Master Flolol\u00F6men\u2019s nose. If she were to possess Victory Bite, she could root out every magical trinket in the Northern hemisphere before the Archive caught so much as a sniff. With the Tempest Bender gloves, she could jury-rig whatever she needed in the field without relying on support and resupply from the Reliquary. Her climb through the ranks of the Order of Power, already precipitous, would become an outright ascension.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nSayadaw found the treasure-hunters easily in the dark. The click-clacking of metal in their blood was as bright as a beacon. There was amusement in getting to see them in person, for she had gathered a certain familiarity with them while she had been tracing their movements across the country. One was a squirrely, pretentious warrior and the other was a hunter who\u2019d have been happier pulling a plough. She certainly felt that she had learned enough about their characters to be able to talk them into selling their Gloves and Crown. She would appeal to the warrior\u2019s vanity and the hunter\u2019s eagerness to please. Kader would supply an implied threat and would catch them if they bolted.\r\n\r\nBut before Sayadaw could even begin her pitch, the little one leapt up, swung his maul and shattered Kader\u2019s helm. Sayadaw responded with violence of her own, but then the massive hunter pulled a legendary Sword out of nowhere and brought down the roof of the cave with one astonishing thunderclap. Sayadaw was left empty-handed, deep underground, with a stricken Kader weeping at her feet.\r\n\r\nAs perplexing as it was to learn that Gloom Bender of Reflection, a Sword thought lost before the Archive was built, had been in the hands of a grubby farmboy, Sayadaw knew that the Sword would save her. Her report on its presence in that cave was able to convince the Judge of the Reliquary that the Sword had been her true goal all along. It was nerve-wracking work to convince the Judge of anything on account of the long pauses between one\u2019s statement and the Judge\u2019s response. It took two days for one of the Judge\u2019s homunculi to fly between Haukpiukpip and the glimmering fjords of Mapkin, where it relayed her words to the man himself, and then two more days for one to return with a fresh imprint of the Judge\u2019s mind. Four days of pacing beside Kader, who woke only occasionally, to mewl and apologise.\r\n\r\nBut with the news of the Sword, the Judge shed grace upon her blunder. Punishment had been deferred to Kaden, whose condition grew worse by the day. There was no place for an enfeebled warrior in the Order of Power, and there would be no place for an eccentric mage overrunning her expenses if she didn\u2019t deliver the Sword before the close of Icewhile.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nSayadaw swept into the research wing of the Library, dealing out instructions to the clerks like playing cards. They coaxed Curator Ozige from her collections and brought her to Sayadaw\u2019s office in the Western tower.\r\n\u201CWhat animal can dig through igneous rock?\u201D Sayadaw asked. Ozige responded at first with an amused snort. She had not seen Sayadaw for weeks and, despite herself, had been expecting at least a short exchange of updates and well-wishes before they proceeded with business. Ozige wondered how consciously Sayadaw was affecting the brusque manner they favoured in the Order of Power. Ozige still remembered the Sayadaw who practised the long, probing greetings of the Order of Vitriol.\r\n\u201CI happen to have papers and specimens of several taxa that fit the description. Could you perhaps try to be more precise?\u201D Ozige clucked.\r\n\u201CIt must be able to survive in salt water,\u201D said Sayadaw, as if that was obvious. Ozige appreciated the combatitative tone, and went to collect the relevant materials for her old student.\r\n\r\nThough Sayadaw had been invited to cross the bridge over the Great Schism to join the Order of Power, she had not forgotten the fundamentals of the teachings of Vitriol. The Order of Vitriol kept an extensive collection of some of the most detailed anatomical texts in the world. To know the entirety of something is to intimately understand its limitations and Vitriol craved ever more specific and precise information about the natural world to feed its desire for ever more specific and precise criticism of human weakness. From the study of nameless invertebrates and long-dead fungus, the Order could determine better than anyone how each quality of a person can be ranked among the endless categories of life. The discovery of a new species, however obscure or familiar, was joyful news to the people taught in the way of Vitriol. It meant they could wield a new tool of unflattering comparison against their friends and families, add new words to their vocabulary of ridicule. As a child, Sayadaw had been taught by Ozige and others the complex inner workings of creatures most people had never heard of. She could inform someone that their breathing was as laboured as a breed of ox known for natal obesity. With one look at a face of a suitor, she could estimate the size of the population of Demodex mites responsible for each blotch and blemish.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sayadaw pored over the centuries of notes and drawings that Ozige had gathered for her. They detailed the inner workings of a species of benthic echinoids that grazed on wood and subsurface gravel. Fully grown, each individual was about the size of a curled thumb, but the zinc-tipped teeth that ringed the chimney of their lantern mouth were powerful. In numbers, they could reduce a sunken tree trunk to splinters in a surprisingly short time. Ozige had chosen a good candidate to solve Sayadaw\u2019s problem, and had provided the maps and charts of the creature\u2019s nervous system. These were vital, for Sayadaw wished to control the movement and behaviour of the echinoids using the Amulet that Ozige had entrusted to her. It had been Ozige\u2019s for her entire life, but the Curator had scarcely understood the true extent of its usefulness before she lent it to her talented student for practice. Ozige had believed the Amulet to be a scarecrow - something that could startle small minds at a distance, make them yelp and flee as though they had received a static shock. But in the hands of Sayadaw, who could see the colours of everything through her eyepiece, the Amulet was a vehicle of subtle and intentional control. Sayadaw could accomplish within minutes what a circus lion-tamer could in weeks. Her graduate thesis took the unusual form of a performance of The Eighth Hymn of Vitriol sung by a flock of dogwoods perched on the gutters of the school building. The recruiter from the Order of Power came looking for her soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrom reading the texts, Sayadaw knew that the echinoids would be a challenge to control and coordinate. She needed to practice, so she instructed an orderly to bring her a cluster of live specimens. She peered into the jar, adjusted her eyepiece and examined the ebb and flow within them, the salt moving in and out of the fibres of their nerves expressed as musical scintillations through the lens. The patterns matched well with what she had learned from the texts. Each spine of their radial bodies was packed with nervous tissue, ending with a long and sensitive foot. An individual had dozens of feet, and each foot was its own inquisitive, hungry set of impulses. She tutted. It would be difficult to control an animal with such a distributed mind. The urchins reminded her of the Judge\u2019s scattered and asynchronous consciousness. She had never met the man in person but had heard that he was as pleasant company as a roiling beehive.\r\n\r\nShe tapped a beat on her Amulet until she found the register of the animal\u2019s thoughts. She visualised herself addressing a hall full of very distracted, very young children. Every child was a foot and each child needed to be constantly reminded of their purpose and direction or they would wander off, unbalancing the whole body, or even wrench themselves from their socket. She introduced a lump of basalt into the jar and compelled the urchins to move towards it and rasp it into sludge. Their jaw strength was up to the task, though the animals very much did not want to. With even a small piece of rock the urchins had cracked tests and splintered teeth. The attrition rate would be high.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Sayadaw went out with Ozige to bully some fishermen. Kezkiisch\u2019s narrow harbour was busy at all hours of the day and night with exchanges of people and goods across the Vibrian to Yunyun and the Hluhah islands. Ozige had worked with many of the regulars at the harbour and knew which boats would be best equipped for the job at hand, so she led the way down the maze of wooden jetties and Sayadaw worked hard to ignore the brilliance of ionised spray scattered out by the sea.\r\n\r\nOzige, striding just ahead of her, snapped her fingers. \u201CYou are distracted, Sayadaw. When you look at too much you see too little,\u201D she said, and Sayadaw felt thirteen years old again. She was a senior Procurer for an office within the Order of Power known and feared across the world, but in that moment she was caught between the rebellious act of keeping her eyepiece on and the wise acceptance of Ozige\u2019s advice. \u201CHave you made an accurate estimation of the total weight of the echinoids required to clear the blockage?\u201D sniffed the Curator. They had arrived at a vessel whose owner often gathered specimens for the Library. It was a softwood coracle, sealed with tar, one of the larger such boats in the harbour. Sayadaw, feeling under pressure, removed her eyepiece and made some quick calculations. She arrived at the conclusion that she would need three full loads of the boat in question.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd in what amount of time will you complete the work?\u201D asked Ozige. Sayadaw believed it would take no more than two days. Ozige chewed her lip as she considered this. She spoke to the fisherman in the latest cipher of Vitriol, and Sayadaw fidgeted anxiously at being out of date. Ozige handed the stout man one of her specimens of the urchin they wanted. It was quite dead, and in bad condition after Sayadaw\u2019s examinations, but he recognised it with no trouble. In the realm of Spezlaas there was no greater authority than a Curator of the Kezkiisch Library but even the most obsequious layman might baulk at a request to dredge fourteen tons of xylophagic urchin from the sea bed. Ozige\u2019s fisherman did no such thing, and went about consulting the network of cousins to which he belonged to find the correct mesh of net for catching urchins. Ozige turned to Sayadaw with eyes like an owl\u2019s during a predatory stoop. \u201CThat is too slow. Gathering fourteen tons will take more than a day. The Archive has been making enquiries. An agent of the Scrollhouse was seen at the hospital and turned up at the Library this morning,\u201D she said and then, after a perfect pause, \u201CWhile you were asleep, like a green dune cicada waiting for the weather to change before it leaves its teneral stage to participate in the world.\u201D\r\nSayadaw bit back a sneer and said, \u201CIf the Archive takes the Sword, the Order of Power\u2019s response will not be gentle. They have armies that will march the entire length of the world to pry such things from dead hands,\u201D she whispered.\r\nOzige was unimpressed. \u201CThen you must save them the bother, so that we are not trampled under that march, Sayadaw. And to do that, you must be quicker.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nSayadaw found the cavern almost exactly as she had left it. No tracks had been tread in the new growth and there was no smell of campfire or the ozone emitted by most wands. There was a griffon bird scouting around for carrion as it wheeled in the sky, a reminder that her last visit had left a corpse underground, tantalisingly out of reach of the patient vulture. She adjusted her eyepiece for a long focus and surveyed the world before her. The anxious flashes of animals, the inverted waterfalls within the trees, the everpresent static hum of the soil. No busy knots of human mind, apart from the sluggish pulses from the procession of weary fishermen. She would be able to see an agent of the Archive coming from miles away.\r\n\r\nBut then she spotted an absence that was a presence. Amidst the crystalline light of the living world was a gap, within which was an inert lumpish shape of a man. It was a homunculus of the Judge, gripped to a high branch of a fleece tree opposite the cavern mouth. No blood flowed through that mass of reticulated fibres, and no sparks jumped to and fro behind its mottled skein. She swallowed the instant swell of revulsion she felt whenever she looked at its blank, colourless body, and carefully pretended not to see it. She instructed the exhausted fishermen to take their stinking, squirming load into the cavern. They dumped the urchins from the nets in the flooded pool at the foot of the cave-in. She handed each of the men a deed for a plot of land that the Order had to spare, which they accepted with barely a word. One by one, they piled into the transport and shuddered away through the valley.\r\n\r\nShe entered the cave and set about the work. Let the Judge watch through his hateful doll, she thought. It was early in the day and he would see her emerge with the Sword before sunset. She sat in the humid dark, which was scored by an orchestra of urchins crinkling their spines together as they settled into the water. One eye was blind in the dark, but the other saw the entangled glow of the creatures as they moved over and under each other. She focused on the nearest individual, found the play of its mind circling the mouth and stretching down the length of each searching spine. She held her Amulet in her right hand and tapped on it with the fingers on her right. Each tap initiated pizoelectric fields from within the glass, which she made overlap with each other until they matched the patterns of the fields emanating from the urchin.\r\n\r\nShe tuned in to the switches and gates and circuits that the creature used to move and feel and understand. An application of a simple pressure on the senses told the urchin that there was an irresistible source of food lying deeper within the cavern. Another touch told it that its companions were not as stressed and panicked as it had previously assessed. Another, and it realised that it was, in fact, alone. It could enjoy a wide berth of space and, if it hurried, would certainly be the first one to reach the food, a victory that would make the meal taste all the sweeter.\r\n\r\nSayadaw, as drum major, led her band to march up to the face of the cave-in and assemble on a space slightly larger in circumference than the guard of a sword. There they could gorge themselves on the most delicious meal of lightly-rotted chalkwillow they have ever had until they were too injured to continue. At this point they would gracefully roll to the side and pass the meal along to a fresher set of jaws.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that the swarm had detected the sharp tang of metal in the water, she directed them to chew in that direction. Slowly but surely, molecule by molecule, the Sword Gloom Bender revealed itself. It took the work of hours for the urchins to gnaw it loose. They wedged themselves under the Sword in the hollow they had made. With careful coordination they could pass it from delicate foot to delicate foot all the way back to Sayadaw. But Sayadaw had her sights set further into the cave. The Sword was what the Judge wanted, but her plans all relied on her finding the Demon Crown, Victory Bite.\r\n\r\nShe felt the smell of bloated human remains, which was a different sensation on the feet of the urchins than it would have been on her nose. To a person, the scent of death is immediately alarming, an urgency propelled by disgust. But the urchins had no interest in meat of any kind, so Sayadaw had to continually replace that disinterest with a different emotion. When, at last, the cave-in was breached, Sayadaw strained the tiny eyes on the end of each tube foot to look for the pale fluorescence emitted by the Crown. She convinced them that it was the blessed light of day, the sun rising behind the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe real sun was beginning to fall in the sky. Sayadaw had been sat, rigid, on the floor of the cave for eight hours. On the journey up, she had wolfed down the lunch of dried figs and tabouleh dumplings that Ozige had packed for her. She was shivering from hunger despite the heat. She had sweat through her clothes and had bundled them into a stinking ball beside her. Her bare feet were submerged in the filthy saltwater, which had been a coolant in the first hour but had been heated above the temperature of her blood. Her face was cramped from squinting through her eyepiece. Her entire body would ache if she allowed herself to feel it, but was hypnotised by the rhythm of the million tube feet: roll, stretch, feel, adhere, roll, over and over. She scarcely registered when the urchins at last found the Crown. They conveyed it, inch by inch, over a carpet of their bodies, towards her.\r\n\r\nAt last the Sword emerged from the fist-sized hole and the sea urchins presented it to her. Gloom Bender had been the conclusion of ancient wars, the dream of empires, but to Sayadaw it looked comical, like a stick inelegantly held in a dog\u2019s mouth. Blinded by sweat and exhaustion, she took the Sword from the cortege, set it down on the pile of her clothes, grit her teeth and concentrated on bringing the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe sun began to set when the first corner of the Crown\u2019s fabric peeked through the borehole. She let out a raspy shout of triumph, abruptly stood and was about to wade through the thicket of urchins to grab it with her own hands before reason intruded and she stopped herself. Her body was in agony. The urchins stopped, confused. She collected herself and began tapping on the Amulet again when Kader stepped through the wall and picked up Gloom Bender from the wet heap she\u2019d left it on.\r\n\r\nSayadaw turned her head so quickly that her eyepiece fell to the floor. She could only make out the outline of Kader\u2019s silhouette in the gloom. All at once, she tried to shout, to object, to attack. By outrage alone she would put the fully-armoured warrior in her place. She lurched one step forward and Kader took one step back, melting into the wall. Gloom Bender was gone.\r\n\r\nShe had no time to scream. She fumbled at her feet for her eyepiece, fastened it to her face, then pelted up the passageway that led outside. In her haste, she stepped on more than one urchin, spines snapping off in her feet along with a drop of venom, but her fury was undeterred. All she needed was to catch sight of a single heartbeat, a single impulse from Kader\u2019s nerves, and she would dog the thief to the ends of the world.\r\n\r\nThe homunculus of the Judge was standing at the mouth of the cave, a purple shadow in the dying light. It asked her, in that approximation of a voice, what the situation was. Sayadaw, her reserves of wit and cunning depleted, only howled, and the homunculus came to the reasonable conclusion that the mission was a failure.\r\n\r\nIt rose in the air, held afloat by the ring it wore as a belt, and Sayadaw saw the supports of her world falling around her. The homunculus would report her failure to the Judge. Her badge of the Reliquary would be retired. They would take her eyepiece, a loss equal to the plucking of her actual eyeball. She would be excommunicated from the Order of Power. Ozige would be struck down by disappointment and shame. The Order of Power would mobilise against the Archive, and when they cracked open its secrets they would fall upon the Library like a thunderbolt. Nothing would remain of Sayadaw\u2019s past, her home, or her future.\r\n\r\nShe watched in horror as the homunculus flew towards the South. There was no time for finesse. She clawed at her Amulet, ensnared the mind of the griffon bird and used it as a missile to swat the homunculus to the ground.\r\n\r\nShe padded over to the stunned brownie on swollen feet. It lay in the dust beside the large carrion bird, which twitched its broken wings as it fitted on its back. Sayadaw took the homunculus from the ground, removed the ring from its waist, and wrung the abomination out like a wet cloth. She took it back into the cave and tossed it to the urchins and then stared into nothing as she advised them to devour the remains. The swarm shuffled the Crown over to her, seeming embarrassed. She held it loosely in her hand and released the urchins. They were free now. They could die here in the cave along with the scores of their worn-out siblings. They could die along with the hunter she had taken the Crown from, along with her entire vision of herself and her career.\r\n\r\nShe slipped the Crown on her head, dressed in her sodden clothes, and limped outside. The air was cool and the roof of the sky was impossibly tall. She had to find a new way forward. But the Crown Victory Bite could find anything.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the Library with a new plan.\r\n}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

He held up his palm, which told his charge it was time to make camp for the day. He had passed through this place many times, and it held no terror for him. He liked it very much, as it was quiet and he knew of dozens of high places where he could stand and regard the scenery as he photosynthesised through the hours of daylight.\r\n\r\nThe Wanderer\u2019s name was Odavwaro \u00F3yan Ediruo, and his charge during this particular crossing of the necropolis was a young mage named Sayadaw. She had recently graduated from a convent school run by Sisters of the Order of Vitriol. Sayadaw watched Odavwaro as he climbed up onto a towering mound of mulch, using vines as nimble handholds, then assumed his lookout at its top. He planted his feet, toes spread wide, his cloak of grass with the hood turned up, draped over the length of his body, and he became quite still. He gazed abstractedly down at the village that had been swallowed by tragedy. Below him were mouldering frames of buildings, dotted by standing stones in their tell-tale pattern. Above him was the dawn, and the sea kneeling before the curve of the horizon. He intended to not move again until evening.\r\n\r\nSayadaw had witnessed this routine every morning of their journey together. That journey was less than halfway done, but it was the longest on which Sayadaw had ever been. It was not an especially long one for Odavwaro, who had walked up and down the length and breadth of the world more times than he could recollect. It was the job of a Wanderer to find exceptional people like Sayadaw and then offer to accompany them to the Realms of Power. Their journey had begun at Sayadaw\u2019s home in the Realm of Spezlaas and would end at the Tides of Tears in the South, where she would be installed at one of the ambitious academies run by the Order of Power. There she could continue her training among the other wunderkinds that the Order had plucked from the trees of the world.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\n\u200B\u200BSayadaw watched Odavwaro for a moment longer as she drained her water flask and plotted out the things that needed to be done during the scrap of morning she had before she needed to sleep. She took out her eyeglass and fastened it to her head. The tube of the eyeglass contained a ring, and when light passed through its mounting it was changed. So when she looked at Odavwaro through it, she saw the pale light of sunrise ripple across Odavwaro\u2019s cloak as thousands of billowing colours. The cloak translated the light into waves down each stalk of long grass like the untwisting of thousands of threads of the finest gossamer. This is how any plant looked in the sunlight when seen through Sayadaw\u2019s eyepiece, but she had yet to become accustomed to the process being in the shape of a man. She noticed that Odavwaro was flowering that day, and tiny buds were emerging from their sheathes on his back. Perhaps that was why he had been especially taciturn for the past few nights. She was undergoing a flowering of a more mammalian type, so she left Odavwaro standing there and found a clump of dense shrubs that provided some privacy from him and the empty town. She removed her wool bandage and swapped it for a clean one. She stamped off to find somewhere to wash.\r\n\r\nOdavwaro heard Sayadaw\u2019s footsteps recede for a considerable distance even over the distant roar of the sea. With his hood up, he could hear for miles around. He had discovered Sayadaw for the first time in exactly this way - by simply waiting in the sun and listening carefully. In the case of Sayadaw, he had been standing on a grassy knoll beside a road in the Realm of Spezlaas when he heard an inexplicable burst of birdsong. While Odavwaro was very tall, and had features rarely seen in that part of the world, he was rarely noticed when he stood out in the open. He made no sound except for the rustling of his cloak and a tiny periodic slurp when he drank the sap that the cloak had made for him. He moved only with the currents of the wind, which a sensible eye was trained to ignore. Only people who knew the area well would spot him, and very few of them had the courage to approach him, though if they did he was perfectly polite according to the rules of all the cultures he wandered through. All of this made him an excellent spy, especially when combined with the keen hearing granted to him by the hood of his cloak. When he stood in the sun on a tall ledge or atop a hill, quite out of anyone\u2019s way, his entire body became an ear. In any given week he heard enough conversations, arguments, plots, gossip, confessions and affairs to fill a library. But while Odavwaro very much enjoyed hearing what people had to say, he kept almost all of it to himself, except for any hints of someone who had found the use of a remnant of the Old War.\r\n\r\nThe Order of Power swept these remnants up from every Realm into which it had sunk its claws. In this, it was much like any of the other Orders that cast their shade across the Earth like looming clouds. But the philosophy of the Order of Power was focused around the cult of the individual and that focus allowed its elders to see that the wielder was often more important than the tool. So while the Archive of the Order of Vitriol isolated the remnants for endless study, and the Royal Houses of the Order of Protection threw them in their vaults and the Order of the Twins bestowed them as gifts to their faithful, the Order of Power preferred to look for people. People who already knew the subtleties of the remnants they possessed, and the best way to put them to use.\r\n\r\nSayadaw had been given such a remnant, fashioned into an Amulet, to train with at her school. She had used it to make a flock of birds whistle a folk song, which Odavwavo heard while he was standing out in the thin Northern sun. He moved closer to the school and discovered, in his utterly passive way, enough about Sayadaw\u2019s skill with the Amulet that he decided to present to her one of the signed and sealed letters from his employers. She was in many ways a perfect candidate - her command of the Amulet was linked to her deep connection with her eyepiece, which was likely a remnant as well. Through her scope, she could see the vital dance of lights that happened inside living things and, with the Amulet, she could tap out her own tune and change the steps of that internal dance from the outside. People in her village spoke of her often, and with admiration, though Sayadaw herself spoke to few of them. Her House was far from destitute but her home was empty, and a sympathetic Sister from the Order of Vitriol would see the opportunity that came from Odavwavo\u2019s letter.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nBeing a charge of Odavwaro the Wanderer did have one persistent drawback - he was slow to remember that other people needed to eat. He had never offered any of them a draw on the well-bitten reeds that fed from his cloak to his mouth, and none had ever asked for it. He did eat with his family when he returned to them for the holiday period but only a small amount, for most foods tasted bitter compared to the nutritious elixir provided by his cloak.\r\n\r\nSo the next thing on Sayadaw\u2019s mind was to find breakfast. Being a creature of the village, she wasn\u2019t much of an outdoorsman, but her marvellous sense of sight helped her forage with some efficiency. Eggs were an easy target because the hard work of building an animal produced a particularly bright soup of lights. She discovered a clearing near a massive gnarled tree surrounded by what appeared to be a garden of large stones. The stones were sunk partway into the soft ground, and covered entirely with moss and creepers so that they looked like tired soldiers guarding mud. Many of those soldier-shapes wore nests as their helm, and those helms seemed like crowns, studded with shining egg-shaped gems, when seen through her eyepiece. She stepped onto one of the broader, flatter stones and leaned across to a taller one so she could pluck two eggs from the nest. As she jumped down, her feet kicked away a chunk of muck from the stone she\u2019d been standing on. Underneath the muck was someone\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\nSayadaw checked with her eyepiece and saw that the hand was not alive. It was, rather, the sculpture of a hand. She gingerly kicked more moss and algae from the stone and found that the hand was clutching a head. The stone on which she had stood to steal eggs was a statue of a woman on her knees, cowering in fear, feebly protecting herself from an unseen assailant. Sayadaw stood, egg held in each hand, and regarded this crystalised moment of horror that had travelled from the past into her current time. Emotions rose within her, but she felt curiosity bob up to the surface of her mind before fear, revulsion or pity.\r\n\r\nShe set her eggs down, found a small stone buried among the undergrowth, and carefully struck the statue of the woman. The blow sent a wave of excitation through the stone that Sayadaw could see as colours through her eyepiece. The internal structure of the rock was not that of a sculpture, but of a fossil, for the mineralized forms of the veins, sinews and bones of this woman were still intact. Sayadaw found this slightly thrilling. She looked about at the overgrown stones about her, and imagined how they might have been distributed. If they were once people, unnaturally turned to stone, they were not standing like a crowd of people would stand. There was enough distance between each statue for her to walk freely, for her to get a look at each one. She was not standing in a crowd but in a gallery. They had either been moved after their fossilisation or had been directed to stand or kneel in their specific place before it happened. She pictured how the scene might look like from above - the statues were arranged more or less radially from the great tree.\r\n\r\nShe had to pause at this point to fend off the grief of a returning mother gull, showering angry calls at the one who had robbed her nest. This prompted the other mothers to answer the call and so Sayadaw\u2019s world was filled with screams and stink and swooping birds. She cursed the birds, then stood her ground while she tried to get a look at the thoughts flashing through their tiny heads. She fished her Amulet out from her vest and tapped on it with her practised fingers, to find the timbre of the furious minds wheeling above her head. This kind of gull didn\u2019t range as far as Spezlaas so she fumbled the control but when she locked on to each bird she could make them relax their wings and careen into the ground. This didn\u2019t seem to damage the gulls but it did give them something else to think about other than Sayadaw\u2019s breakfast.\r\n\r\nShe sat in the lee of two statues embracing at the foot of the tree, and made a small fire over which she heated her little skillet. While the metal came up to temperature she examined the tree. It resembled a wild plum but with thornier leaves, and much larger than any Sayadaw had seen. All at once she realised that the tree had been trained into a particular shape - pliable branches had been bent and woven by human hands and had then hardened into wood. She studied the tree through her eyepiece as she cracked an egg onto her skillet. The tree was turning air into food just like trees and Odavwaro did, but the colours dancing from leaf to trunk to root were different. The hues were off, the intensity shifted, the connections more complicated. She rose, eyepiece clutched between her brow and cheek, and carried her remaining egg to the trunk of the tree. She cracked it above the roots and let the contents fall to the ground. This was an eccentricity of hers that she had picked up at an early age. It was a delight to her to see the soil come alive when it was offered something as immediately digestible and nutritious as an egg. Thousands of living things clamoured for the jelly seeping into the dirt, making their bargains with each other, staging ambushes and calling in alliances. It was like being able to summon up a private showing of a subterranean aurora borealis that shimmered for miles in every direction beneath her feet.\r\n\r\nBut this time, in this place, before the great tree of the fallen necropolis, the aurora reflected something different. The tiny fibres at the ends of the tree roots lurched for the prize with a selfish ferocity and speed that shocked Sayadaw. It was more like watching the orderly procession of a troop of ants than anything botanical. The root system bullied all other living components of the soil into submission, and would leave them barely a scrap to share amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nThe smell of burning caused Sayadaw to leap over to her own egg, and she let out a wail of lament at her breakfast rendered inedible. She became incandescent with fury for a hot second and her mind worked hard to find a way that Odavwaro could be to blame for the prolongation of her hunger. But, as inventive as she was, she could not calculate a way to make that blame plausible. She endeavoured to calm down by studying the tree once again. She stood above the egg she\u2019d given to the soil and tried not to feel resentful towards it.\r\n\r\nAny other observer might have noticed that the egg was not attracting flies or worms, and was soaking into the ground a little quicker than it ought to. But Sayadaw\u2019s practised eye, squinting through her brass tube, saw that the egg was being rapidly disassembled. The substance of it was being drawn into the roots in a tight spiral which twisted towards a black bulb deep beneath the trunk of the tree. She saw that the entire tree was growing out of that darkness. Judging by the power with which the tree was consuming the egg, she estimated that most of the tree\u2019s body was hidden inside of the bulb. The blackness of it was unnerving to Sayadaw, as the world seen through her eyepiece was one of constant light. She knew that, to her human eyes, black meant an absence of light. She was less sure what black meant through her eyepiece. Her Amulet appeared black when not in use, but as soon as she tapped on its surface it exploded with colour - the colours which ran through metal, under the skin of living things and down the leaves of plants. The colours she saw were the secret lights that bound her body to earth, the earth to the sky and the sky to the sea.\r\n\r\nWas the black bulb underneath the tree something outside of all those things?\r\n\r\nShe removed her Amulet from its place around her neck and put it on the ground near the egg. It was a jewel of perfect opacity against the seething storm of light. If the tree was not quite a tree, then perhaps she could interfere with the pathways of its mind the way she could with animals and people. She focused on the pulses entering the black bulb. She tapped on the Amulet, sending waves of interference through the soil. She saw a faint shimmering of the waves cancelling each other out and improved her patterning. Something caught, and she felt the delight of discovery. Then, she saw the Amulet turn bright white for an instant, and her mind shattered.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nOdavwaro rocked on the balls of his heels, sipped nectar through one of the straws that connected his gut to the inner workings of his cloak, and wondered in a distant way what harm might befall Sayadaw as she walked alone through the necropolis. People for hundreds of miles in every direction had concocted stories about the place. Though the stories were often entertaining, Odavwaro had seen no substance of them during his visits there. All he saw was the usual sort of life blanketed thick over an abandoned town. Whatever had made the statues did it long ago. He often felt that the world was far less dangerous than people wanted it to be. But Odavwaro, who walked only at night, who needed no sleep, who trod lightly and carried no weapon, had in his long life seen mostly sunshine and peace.\r\n\r\nHe supposed Sayadaw could fall while exploring, or could be trapped if a house collapsed with her inside it. He had only lost one charge before - an androgyne teen who had been bitten by a water snake and drowned. Odavwaro thought of them sometimes, though he had not told anyone what had happened. The Order of Power hadn\u2019t noticed, as Odavwaro was not in contact with his handlers except when he arrived at their door with a fresh recruit. When he had discovered the body it was too late, he had left it for the soil to reclaim and embarked on a new search.\r\n\r\nSometimes, by happenstance, he heard about what had become of a former charge of his. They all thrived at the academies, for Odavwaro was an excellent judge of character. But the Order of Power set them against each other, so they often fell victim to their former classmates when the intensity of the rivalry imposed upon them met the danger they could cause through mastery of their craft. The heartless ones and the lucky made it through, fully ordained as a hunter or warrior or mage. With a mixture of grim realisation and strange pride he felt that Sayadaw would make it too.\r\n\r\nThen he heard her scream. He turned his head a fraction of an arc towards its source. She had been making breakfast and then she had indulged in her habit of feeding an egg to the ground that Odavwaro disapproved of but never acknowledged. He had heard her burn her breakfast, express some rage and then she had gone rather quiet. He turned towards the direction of the tree as he sucked up a mouthful of honey. If anything, it would be the tree, he thought, and he strode away from his perch.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nSayadaw was both blinded and seeing too much. She could still hear the sounds of the peaceful meadow in which she stood while she saw a cacophony of shapes and movements that threatened to deafen her. Urgent winds blew within her body and she tasted saltpeter with her toes. She staggered away on weeping legs and scoured the texture of failure and fear from her arms. She swung around the pair of entwined statues and put their reassuring weight between herself and the Amulet, glowing like the Sun at the foot of the tree. The assault of sensation faded, her eyes slowly rediscovered how to see images and her hallucinations morphed into the familiar feeling of mere pain. The muscles in her ribs and back had been sprained, and she realised her throat was hoarse from shouts she had not heard. She vomited over the feet of both statues, which helped to clear her head. She sat with her back pressed against stone and haltingly forced herself to peek back at the Amulet through her eyepiece. It was once again black as night. She breathed, and then a shadow passed over her. Odavwaro was blocking the light.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat?\u201D she snapped. Odavwaro looked at her, then at the vomit in her hair, then at the ruined egg on the skillet, then over at the tree. He sustained a long, thoughtful inhalation of air.\r\n\u201CYour Amulet is on the ground,\u201D he said at last. Odavwaro was not inclined to speak out loud so this observation was his version of a gigantic reprimand. Sayadaw felt it like a sharp slap across her face.\r\n\u201CI dropped it when I was being sick,\u201D she muttered but Odavwaro was away. He covered the ground between the statues and the Amulet in three strides then stopped to peer at it. He dropped to his knees. It was a ridiculous thing to see someone so tall bend themselves to be so close to the ground. His knees thrust out like lances and his cloak fell across the ground like an outstretched palm going to seed. He produced a finger and hovered it over the cold surface of the glass.\r\n\u201CThis is what you used to make the birds sing,\u201D he said. Sayadaw detected no question and so remained silent, though she rose to her feet and floated towards Odavwaro\u2019s presence. He was humming The Eighth Hymn of Vitriol, the song that Sayadaw had compelled the birds to sing on the roof of her school, almost imperceptibly to the ground. Then he twisted his head towards Sayadaw, and she felt the uncanny sensation of a hillock turning to notice her.\r\n\u201CPerhaps you are lucky the birds did not make you sing,\u201D he said. He retracted his hand into his cloak and stood up. Sayadaw clacked her teeth once with irritation and decided to share some details.\r\n\u201CIt tried to send something to me. It wanted to command me to do something. But it didn\u2019t know how to do it properly,\u201D she said.\r\n\u201CThe tree?\u201D asked Odavwaro, studying it. It was the only one of its kind he had seen, though that was not so strange by itself, as rare and singular things were often found by Wanderers.\r\n\u201CThe tree is a feeding apparatus. The main body of the creature is inside a bag buried underneath us,\u201D she said. Odavwaro grimaced at that, for he knew about the bags that the world held hidden about itself. They could contain more than they seemed to be able to, sometimes a lot more. Remnants of the Old War were often found inside of them. Sometimes demons made lairs in them. He carefully picked up a leaf from the tree that had fallen to the ground. It wasn\u2019t really a leaf at all, now that he thought to look at it properly. He nodded, a small gesture of recognition from one spy to another. He let the leaf fall and started to walk away. He held his palm up behind him, a signal to Sayadaw that she should follow him.\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D she said. Odavwaro continued to walk. He was not a treasure hunter. The Order of Power paid him handsomely, and they paid him to find people. He would not gamble their safety on whatever was held in that forgotten bag.\r\n\u201CI want to know what it wants,\u201D called Sayadaw. Odavwaro paused. His own curiosity was rising within him.\r\n\u201CIt made you cry out. It wanted to lure in others,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CBut why would it do that?\u201D asked Sayadaw. Odavwaro consulted his internal record of everything he knew about demons.\r\n\u201CSo it can eat them,\u201D he said.\r\n\u201CIt didn\u2019t eat you and I can\u2019t see any bones or teeth under the ground. If it wants to eat people it hasn\u2019t done it before.\u201D said Sayadaw. Odavwaro turned to face her and the tree that wasn\u2019t a tree. It was a feeding apparatus. It ate the light and whatever decomposed at its roots. It stood in the sun and waited and listened until it found someone of interest. If it found one, where would it want to take them?\r\n\u201CHow will you know what it wants?\u201D said Odavwaro at last.\r\n\u201CTrial and error,\u201D said Sayadaw, her eyes flaring.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nSleep was out of the question when there was a mystery to untangle so Sayadaw conducted her experiments throughout the day while Odavwaro stood in supervision from a safe distance away. Distance was the key, as the tree demon could not send a signal to the Amulet that was strong enough to debilitate her when she stood a certain distance away. This was something she already understood from her own use of the Amulet - fine and forceful work was best accomplished up close, and the tree demon did not have the benefit of years of practice. If she tapped into the tree demon\u2019s mind from up close, she would suffer the kind of fits that had her father confined to the asylum for most of his life. But outside of what was once the village square, she suffered only nausea and visual disturbances. The angle at which she held the Amulet was also a factor. If she held it up above her head, aimed at the sky, when she tapped into the tree demon\u2019s lights, very little of the response was reflected back into her nerves and brain.\r\n\r\nThen came the understanding of blocking. The Amulet could not send a strong signal through the stone statues. If Sayadaw hugged one of the statues so that she was behind its dense material and the Amulet held in her hands facing the tree demon directly, she could avoid the worst effects to her senses but produce terrible muscle cramps in her exposed hands. After some coaxing she was able to bring Odavwaro close enough to demonstrate that his cloak acted as an effective shield. If he had his back turned to the Amulet then he suffered almost no ill effects from the confusion it beamed out when angled towards him.\r\n\r\nThe breakthrough came when Sayadaw saw how Odavwaro\u2019s cloak responded when it was bathed in the Amulet\u2019s broadcast. Through her eyepiece she saw the grass flicker and flare in a way it did in mere sunlight. He reported that it tickled some, and was mildly unpleasant but otherwise bearable. So by crouching behind one of the kneeling statues and with Odavwaro\u2019s back positioned just so, Sayadaw could cast the tree demon\u2019s thoughts onto his cloak like a screen that only she could see.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nThe sun was climbing down the sky when meaningful communication was established. During the experimental phase the tree demon was learning as much about sending as Sayadaw was learning about receiving. When it had reached out to Sayadaw initially, it had been trying to speak normally, and Sayadaw\u2019s physiology was simply not compatible. Gradually it understood that it could limit the scope of its speech to produce certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that would cause photoexcitation in the leaves of green plants. And so eventually it figured out how to draw pictures with its words - pictures that Sayadaw could see on Odavwaro\u2019s cloak through her eyepiece.\r\n\r\nThey were abstractions by necessity and crude by craft but Sayadaw could recognise that three circles, by way of their relative sizes and positions, were a depiction of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, just as she\u2019d learned at the nunnery. A blob moved on a trajectory between the Earth and the Moon and moved into the Earth. She had seen meteorites and even a comet when she was a girl.\r\n\r\nThe scene was repeated again and again until the scale changed. Now the meteorite blob was the focus and it was filled with squiggly asterisks that Sayadaw understood represented trees, meaning they were others like the tree demon itself. They were scattered across the curve of the Earth, inside little raindrop shapes. After that the scene became less clear. There were rows of indistinguishable asterisks, shapes that were unrecognisable, circles with lines drawn between them that resembled constellations, and then endless repetition. As evening set in the drawings became brighter and more vivid in contrast but then Odavwaro turned towards her and the screen closed. He held up his hand and signalled that it was time to walk.\r\n\r\nSayadaw was too exhausted to protest. She was aching everywhere from the unnatural movements of hugging the statues and operating the Amulet. She had completely forgotten about eating for the entire day. Her feet were leaden and her mind was both sluggish and racing. She struggled to keep pace with the Wanderer as he marched them towards their next camping spot, with its perch for him and mysteries for her. She thought about running back to the tree, of finding a shovel to dig the bag out from under it, and drawing every secret from the demon stuck inside of it: Where were the other trees, where did they come from and what did they keep inside the black bags from which they sprouted? But they walked on in darkness, guided by Odavwaro\u2019s hearing, and even with her eyepiece she wouldn\u2019t be able to find her way back to the necropolis at night.\r\n\r\nOdavwaro was consumed with thoughts of his own. He thought of his family, who he would see when the lunar holiday came, which was quite soon. His fee was enough that they lived lavishly in one corner of the Realms of Power, the closest thing to aristocrats that the Order could tolerate. Soon he would sit with them and hear of all their stories and triumphs and defeats and gossip. He would eat food again while his oldest grandson practised wearing Odavwaro\u2019s cloak. Every night he would picture every one of his children and grandchildren, his nieces and nephews and all the spouses they collected. But on that night he also pictured all his former charges, most of which had also passed through the necropolis. He tried to count how many had fallen short of the Order\u2019s exacting standards, which put failure, infirmity and sometimes kindness in the same standing as death.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nWhen dawn came again they had reached the outskirts of the coastal town of Pasapi. Sayadaw was so exhausted that she collapsed almost as soon as Odavwaro held up his palm to tell her to stop the march. He found himself showing her a secluded place to wash, and when she returned he had brewed a sweet tea from the nectar made by his cloak. She sat with him by the fire and sipped it gratefully. She noticed that it helped ease her cramps.\r\n\r\nWhen she lay down to sleep she called Odavwaro to her side. She had a strange expression on her face when she asked, \u201CWill the Order be pleased to know I have found a bag for them, and a dormant demon?\u201D Odavwaro was silent, which was all the response Sayadaw expected of him. He realised that her expression was strange because it was childlike, one he saw on the face of his grandchildren when they wanted an adult to be impressed by them. He felt he had something inside of himself that it was important to share.\r\n\u201CThe Order doesn\u2019t need to know,\u201D he said. \u201CThey have bags of their own. The secret of the necropolis is yours and mine, but I give my share to you. It is a present. It will help you, I think,\u201D\r\nSayadaw\u2019s face dissolved into a little frown, which remained until she presently passed into sleep. Odavwaro stayed at her side for a while. He tried to picture the trials she would face and failed, but knew that she would be better prepared than most.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose and he found a place near the edge of a cliff and stood to meet it.\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

Wherever he went, people moved away from him. If they were alone, they ran. If they were in groups, they dispersed. When he looked inside the yurts, all were empty.\r\n\r\nHis law carried no power in Sonton, but his voice did.\r\n\r\n\u201CWE SAW THE SMOKE,\u201D he said to a beekeeper up on the hill. She had been building a shelter against the wind. The force of the Sheriff\u2019s voice knocked over a stack of hives. The clay pipes broke when they fell at the beekeeper\u2019s feet. She did not look at the Sheriff and did not answer him. She ducked her head low and disappeared behind the ridge.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff stood alone and twisted a lock of his long hair between his fingertip and thumb. The Order of Fury had tolerated this tiny Republic for a generation. It had spread in all directions out of Mlunplin town and taken in refugees from the entire island until much of the Realm of Ponmom was outside of the Order\u2019s influence. The Republic wanted to be ignored by the Order, and the Order was content to ignore it. But then the Brothers had seen the chimneys, and then the Worm, and knew that it was past time to bring the Republic to heel.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff returned to his battleforged camel and filled her feedbag. He fastened her ear protectors and adjusted his necklace. He turned his voice up as loud as he would dare it to go. He walked to the spot he perceived to be the nucleus of the village of Sonton: a circle of chopped stumps attached around an iron stove. He spoke.\r\n\r\n\u201CI HOLD A WARRANT FROM THE ORDER. I WILL INSPECT THE IRON WORM.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nThere were hundreds of Free Republics that clung like lichen to the edges of the world. They filled up its cracks, floated off shore or burrowed underground. They were made of many shapes and ideas, but all had this in common: they stood where the Orders did not. The Free Republic of Ponmon was one of the more strident.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff\u2019s voice created currents that threw up dust. When the echoes faded and the dust settled, Ouma Tau appeared. She had been tanning a yak hide so was covered in grime. The Sheriff had never seen a face so wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn a man\u2019s greeting lies his character,\u201D said Ouma. \u201CYou are a shameless pig. A nuisance. You have upset the bees.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff touched his necklace. He spread his voice only a little further than his throat could project. \u201CI would say the same about the greeting given to me by the people of Sonton. I saw no Banner to welcome me to your House.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is no Banner here. There is no House, just people.\u201D said Ouma.\r\n\r\n\u201CThose people have not answered my salutation, they have turned away from me,\u201D said the Sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe old woman laughed as if she had heard something obvious.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe people cannot see a guest that is carrying Calamities!\u201D she said, pointing a mocking finger at the Sheriff. \u201CThe chain around your throat, your armour, your bludgeon. Even your camel, I think!\u201D she waved in the direction of the beast, who was still chewing her way through her feedbag. \u201CCalamities, we can do without. There are calamities everywhere in the world, but not here. We have no Order so we have no Calamities. This keeps fortune on our side. Surrender yours, or leave.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff recognised the tone of authority.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are the leader here?\u201D he asked, his voice lowered a notch in respect.\r\n\r\n\u201CI tan the hides, I split the hives, I spoil the children,\u201D Ouma said, gazing abstractedly at the hills.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff spat. His patience was exhausted.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut you are lying,\u201D he said, marching past the old woman. \u201CYou have the Worm.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe thought about this for a moment.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Worm is not a Calamity,\u201D she called, and walked after him. He was surprised at how quickly she matched his pace. He was heading downhill towards the valley.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have the expertise to identify one. They can take many guises,\u201D he snarled.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Worm is not one,\u201D she repeated. Their walk had gathered some attention. The Sheriff saw men appear at the tops of the cliffs. He measured the distances, turned up his voice, and spoke three words at each of them. The words ballooned inside their bodies. They doubled over with pain and fell, gasping, to their knees.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are so frightened by my grandchildren that you\u2019ve hurt them,\u201D chuckled Ouma. \u201CHow great and powerful your magic is!\u201D The Sheriff turned to her and spoke another word:\r\n\r\n\u201CCOMPLY.\u201D\r\n\r\nOuma crumbled like a log burned through. She coughed and coughed. The Sheriff tried to explain himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CI have seen the smoke of the Worm, I have heard its cries. You people claim to forsake the magic but every time you crawl back to it like a dog at the back door.\u201D Ouma said nothing, the wind was gone from her. She shook her head, and even this somehow had a hectoring tone to the Sheriff.\r\n\r\n\u201CSince you are now making use of magic, your land must respect the authority of the Order. Without our guidance, you will misuse it. People will be hurt, and killed. We have seen it happen again and again.\" He gathered himself. \u201CCover your ears, grandmother,\u201D he said to her and then, to everyone:\r\n\u201CTHIS HOUSE IS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE ORDER OF FURY. WE WILL SEND A BROTHER WITH A BANNER, AND WE WILL BUILD AN ABBEY FOR HIM. YOU WILL FEED HIM AND RESPECT HIS WISHES, FOR THEY ARE THE WISHES OF THE ORDER. ANY ACT AGAINST YOUR BROTHER WILL BE AN ACT AGAINST THE ORDER.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff\u2019s hair settled again around his shoulders. His pulse was racing from the exertion. He had no doubt that the people of Sonton had heard his voice. Since they had heard it, they were now subject to the law. He helped Ouma Tau to her feet.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt will be for the best,\u201D he said, with his plain voice. \u201COur Brother and our Banner will stand guard against others who would use the Relics to conquer you. You won\u2019t have to be afraid of outsiders.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou should be afraid of us,\u201D said Ouma, her face a deep scowl. The Sheriff looked at the old woman, barely standing. He looked at her grandchildren that had tried to attack him, who were staggering off to hide again. He looked around at the frightened faces peering out from behind trees and yurts. He allowed the old woman her pride. He held her small brown hand in his.\r\n\r\n\u201CPlease show me the Worm,\u201D he asked.\r\n\r\nShe led him towards the coast, into the valley. This is where he had seen the smoke rise. The mage from his office had heard the breathing come from within the mountain. He wondered how the people had caught the Worm and how they controlled it. In the valley was a well-worn path leading towards the entrance of a coal mine cut into the cliff face. The mines in Sonton provided coal for much of the Realm. The Republics were especially reliant on it as a source of heat and fuel. They walked on the path, overshadowed by the cliffs. The Sheriff could smell the sea air.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ve already had one,\u201D muttered Ouma Tau.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat was that, grandmother?\u201D asked the Sheriff. She had been quiet and pliant now that she knew what his voice could do. He had been easy on her - sometimes he had been forced to use it lethally. He could rupture lungs and make brains into jelly.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen I was a girl, we had a Brother. He lived just there, in a fine abbey. The tallest building for miles.\u201D \u201D she pointed at an indistinguishable scrap of land. \u201CWhen we decided we wanted no part in the Order, he went over the cliff, just there.\u201D It was clear enough what she was pointing at then. The Sheriff gave a short, ugly laugh. There was much to doubt about the story, and he admired the old woman for her spirit. He knew what the repercussions would be for a House that killed its attendant Brother. Even one Advocate of the Order could lay this Realm to waste. The leaders would be culled with the cattle. The crops and the dwellings burned. He estimated that he could do all of that here, single-handedly, in an afternoon. He whistled as the entrance to the mine loomed closer. He could hear something coming from within.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is the breathing of the Worm?\u201D the Sheriff asked. Ouma Tau nodded. He activated his breastplate, which shone a bright beam ahead of him. He entered the mine and Ouma Tau lagged behind. The breathing was short and deep. The Sheriff had not heard anything quite like it.\r\n\r\nHis suspicions about the Worm were confirmed - it was a massive beast. Had it been made artificially large by a Relic, or was it a demon of an unknown nature? Had the people here captured it somehow, or were they in its thrall?\r\n\r\nHis spirit sang. He looked back at the entrance to the mine, where the frightened silhouettes of villagers swam. He was not afraid so he pressed on. His voice could tame any monster. The larger the foe, the more pressure he could exert on its innards. He adjusted his necklace to a suitable power for a stunning blow. The breathing was deafening.\r\n\r\nThe beam from his chestplate caught a moment of movement. A blurred set of pikes, attached to a whirling mass, chopping as if held by runners. The Sheriff had all of half a second to inspect the Worm before it hit him. His armour took the brunt of the impact but its beam was extinguished. The Sheriff was carried backwards by the blow and the Worm ran along with him. He discovered that he was being held by the sleeve of his coat. The sleeve tugged and then dragged him along with the Worm as it galloped towards the mine\u2019s entrance. The incessant panting of its lungs filled his head. A rectangle of daylight ran towards him, and he calculated the unearthly speed at which the Worm was lunging out of its lair. He worked to free his sleeve and the Worm took hold of his hair in jealousy. It pulled with a leaden millstone grasp. The Sheriff found his footing along the floor of the mine and brought his knife up with his free hand. He tore back his sleeve and cut free his hair. The Worm ran ahead still clutching his hair in its claws. He ran behind it to slow his momentum and keep from falling. The Worm punched into the light and the Sheriff sprinted to catch it.\r\n\r\nHe had the span of a few footsteps to try and make sense of the Iron Worm\u2019s nature. It was indeed made of iron, but the idea of it being a beast fell short. It had no head to speak of, and where he had expected to see the clattering legs of a centipede there were small wheels. It was segmented, but in the same way a series of wagons were hitched together. As he saw it speed into the distance he saw that the Iron Worm was trailing behind it many containers of coal.\r\n\r\nHe stood at the opening of the mine and adjusted his necklace. His confusion hardened to anger. A contraption for hauling coal had nearly taken his scalp. He would slay this beast that was never a beast with one almighty shout.\r\n\r\nTwo men in veils appeared at his left side and threw a heavy clay pipe at him. It glanced off his side and broke on the ground. The two men were already in a run when the Sheriff turned to them. Another pair, carrying another pipe, appeared at his right side. He saw the ambush and inhaled, ready to strike them both dead for this childishness.\r\n\r\nThe clay pipes were the housings of a beehive. The pipe that had broken at the Sheriff\u2019s feet had released thousands of angry bees into the air. So when the Sheriff inhaled, a bee was sucked into the upper part of his trachea. The bee panicked and stung the inside of his throat. The Sheriff coughed, which sent a thunderclap into the cliffside and crushed the bee. He choked on the bee\u2019s carcass as her sisters fell upon him with vengeance.\r\n\r\nOne of the veiled men who had thrown the pipe moved through the cloud of bees and removed the Sheriff\u2019s necklace. The Sheriff was quite helpless and entering anaphylaxis. He was sure to hurt someone while coughing and spluttering with such a powerful voice. The necklace was taken to Ouma Tau, who was standing a safe distance away. When the Sheriff was dead and the bees had settled down they collected his body, along with his breastplate. Ouma Tau led them to the top of the cliff and they threw the entire collection of things into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff\u2019s camel, they let go. She was relieved of her saddlebags and harness and allowed to wander wherever she wished.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nThe Iron Worm went on its way out of Sonton. It pulled its train of coal to Mlonpon, then on to the Mlunplin. With each delivery, the Realm of Ponmom became a little less dependent on the Order for heat and light and food. The tracks that the Worm dug in the ground were arteries that carried the life blood of the Free Republic.\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

    "\r\nGenesis Scrolls Round 3: {The hunted did a-hunting go}\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nSep 2022\r\nSep 2022\r\n\r\nTicklish\r\nSep '22\r\nName\/Pseudonym: {Ticklish}\r\nContact Info: {https:\/\/twitter.com\/ticklishart}\r\nEthereum Wallet Address: {0xB1b3751834646fb999EDd18CA62C69663071cF43}\r\n\r\nAuthor\u2019s note: This story takes place immediately after the events of None So Blind. 2 It also heavily references events and characters from Fallen Cavern. 1 Sayadaw\u2019s long-term plans involve the events of Sow the Wind and begin to form in Fallen Necropolis.\r\n\r\nThe hunted did a hunting go\r\nThe first a thief who walked too slow\r\nShe stole a piece of the second one\u2019s beau\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh\r\n\r\nKader\u2019s head was pounding and her eyes were blurry but she was propelled forward by the force of her betrayal.\r\n\r\nShe had been a loyal warrior for the Order of Power since she was a young girl but then she had been injured in the line of duty and callously discarded. She hiked across the dull grey stone of Nuiknaauiena, under forest and shade wherever she could.\r\n\r\nWhen agents of the Order of Vitriol had asked her to snatch a treasure away from the Order of Power she had accepted without much resistance. Vitriol worshipped weakness, in its own fashion, the way that Power worshipped strength. Kader and her broken head belonged there now. And so she pressed on, dizzy and short of breath, with the stolen Sword on her Belt. She was to meet her new handler from the Scrollhouse of \u00EBn Um\u00EBl in the forest ruins outside the Realm. They would take the Sword from her and so would let her remain as a warrior, and she would keep the Boots she had mastered and the Belt that had been in her family for generations.\r\n\r\nKader leaned underneath the swollen shelter of a fleece tree at the base of the Viper\u2019s Peak. She scanned the sky for dangers - hunters blessed with flight, or a vegetative drone bound to the Judge of the Reliquary, but the day was clear and lovely. She needed to drink, for her injury was drawing a heavy thirst and her supplies were low, so she looked to the insects and the greenery to lead her to water.\r\n\r\nShe did not have the imagination to picture what her future would hold. She had upheld every instruction that the Order had given her since she had been enrolled at the prestigious Academy of Light in Mapkin. She had polished her armour with pride, vanquished enemies and traitors and recovered land and loot to swell the Order\u2019s might. Before her last mission had gone wrong and she\u2019d been struck by a rival warrior, she was on a resolute path to prefectship and then martial command over a Realm as a Lord. Now she was a lost thing, a vagrant, a courier between squabbling giants. The Order of Vitriol had given no firm assurances to her in exchange for the Sword, and she didn\u2019t have to dig deep within herself to realise she didn\u2019t deserve any.\r\n\r\nPresently she came to a river. It was cold as bliss so she wet a rag to tie around her aching head, removed her Boots, which gave her steps the magic to pass through solid things, and washed her swollen feet. As she wriggled the nubs of her toes in the stream she unclipped the silver cups from her Belt and filled them from the river. The cups could make any water they held fresh and drinkable. The Belt was the only memory she had of her House for it was engraved with its old name: Whisper.\r\n\r\nWith her head soothed, her feet relieved and her thirst quenched, Kader became dangerously close to becoming comfortable. Her eyes fell upon the little figure in the distance, some mountain-man scrabbling in the river for food from the bony oyster reef that pointed at intervals out from the mud. She almost dismissed the shape as being harmless before some part of her, a part that could never be comfortable, sounded the alarm and made her lie back, out of sight. Her hand was on the hilt of the fearsome Sword she had stolen from him.\r\n\r\nThe hunted did a-hunting go\r\nThe next a scrounge with guilt in tow,\r\nHe made a mess from his love and woe,\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh\r\n\r\nAvanesh had been walking in circles. His equipment, which included his compass, had been drowned in the cave he\u2019d been prospecting. Drowned along with his clothes, his maps, and his husband.\r\n\r\nHe had escaped that horror with only his Gloves and a stub of his life. He had wormed his way through a narrow tunnel towards daylight while the cavern flooded below him. The love of his fairly short and mostly desperate life, Bahadur, had been unable to follow. Bahadur\u2019s Crown had helped him find the tunnel to the surface but he couldn\u2019t have fit through it himself and, well, he was in a bad state when Avanesh last saw him. So Avanesh had pressed on through the daylight, naked in the brisk autumn air, with grief snapping at his heels.\r\n\r\nHis Gloves were made from the hide of a demon, one that presumably had the acumen of an engineer imprinted in its flesh, for the Gloves gave Avanesh an uncanny sense of creation. When he held something in his hand, the Gloves gave him a sense of how it could be shaped and incorporated into a craft. The Gloves completed the link in Avanesh\u2019s mind between material and potential.\r\n\r\nAnd so after his escape from the murderous cave, he stitched together leaves with caterpillar silk to make a rainjacket. He filtered water through charcoal and knapped flint to make blades for all occasions. He hiked cross-country to find the path home but the Gloves could not tell him which way to go. One night as he prepared a fire to cook the grubs he had dug from a mound, he searched around in the evening\u2019s light for a dull flint to make a spark and briefly handled a flat grey rock. On contact with that rock the Gloves flared in his mind, telling him how the rock could be shattered into needles, and how those needles would point towards the North when floated on water.\r\n\r\nThat morning he descended to the river with a flake of magnetite, cupped some water in his hand and let the unseen forces of the world point him towards home. His other hand trailed in the river\u2019s stream, and some tiny part of his mind observed that there was revenge in the water. He glanced upstream just in time to see a seated woman watching him. She ducked down too late to avoid his sight. He picked up a fist of stone from the river and his Gloves told him it was harder than a skull.\r\n\r\nThe hunted did a hunting go\r\nThe last one here, the virtuoso,\r\nHer bloody plans nearing crescendo\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh\r\n\r\nSayadaw saw the devastation from the air. The Crown she wore was quite unnecessary for finding her quarry when the entire fleece forest of Haukpiukpipi pointed it out like a vast hound made of flames. A crater at the edge of the forest told her that the Sword had been unsheathed.\r\n\r\nShe had spent the last of her goodwill with the Order of Vitriol on the commandeering of a child-taker eagle from the Tiergarten of Kezkiisch. The bird was one half of the only breeding pair of its species that the Order possessed, the largest of its genus and the most effective means to catch Kader that Sayadaw had access to.\r\n\r\nSayadaw dangled in a harness bound to the child-taker\u2019s talons and steered her by the emenations of her Amulet. The eagle had swallowed the distance between the soot-covered rooftops of Spezlaas and the austere mountains of Nuiknaauiena with little trouble. The Crown she had taken such pains to fish from the fallen cavern guided her flight straight towards the Sword that Kader had and everybody wanted. If Kader succeeded in delivering it to her new masters in the Order of Vitriol, Sayadaw\u2019s masters in the Order of Power would upend the world to wrestle it back. The destruction that had already touched Haukpiukpipi would bring adventurers from every Order to the scene and Sayadaw, who had more imagination than most, could not predict an outcome to this that did not lead to a full-blown interordinal war.\r\n\r\nThe Crown rang in her ears without sound and she rapped on her Amulet to bring the eagle down. In the fading twilight she saw a pit among the smouldering trees. She unfastened the straps that held her in the talons and landed on the soil without much grace. Her mount was unsettled by the smoke and the fire but she kept it planted to the ground by dampening its senses.\r\n\r\nThe pit had been dug roughly but functioned well as a trap for a person. Sayadaw crouched at its edge and saw the shivering form of Kader sat at its bottom. The Crown had already notified her that the Sword was not in there with her but Sayadaw, raised in the ways of Vitriol, could not avoid her duty to admonish and correct her former lieutenant.\r\n\u201CA good thief has cunning, resolve, and a certain knack for not falling into holes. Oh, and I see you\u2019ve lost your Boots too,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\nKader got to her feet, her head rising to a level just below Sayadaw\u2019s bandaged feet. The history of inversions of their respective positions played over her face. Kader had been brought up in the Realms of Power and had defected to the Order of Vitriol. Sayadaw had been born in the Realms of Vitriol and had been recruited into the Order of Power. Now the two of them had been disgraced in the eyes of both organisations. These twists were too strange for Kader to keep in focus, so she stuck to the facts of the matter.\r\n\u201CThe warrior, Avanesh Tipanis Angle, ambushed me while I bathed. He manoeuvred me towards a defensive trench he had dug beforehand,\u201D she said, preferring to pretend for the moment that Sayadaw was still her commanding officer.\r\n\u201CHe ambushed you while you were carrying the weapon that can end wars,\u201D observed Sayadaw, letting the statement hang as she feigned a loss of interest. Kader straightened her face. Her nostrils flared and her jaw tightened.\r\n\u201CI wasn\u2019t trained in the operation of the Sword,\u201D she said, and began to weep. Sayadaw hated that. She hadn\u2019t ever got used to the emotional incontinence that the Order of Power encouraged its adherents to practice. She rose to her feet and tried to ignore Kader and instead focus on the Crown she wore. She was no expert in its use but it had led her to Kader. She fumbled through her mind to present the Crown an image of Avanesh it could use. Slowly a sensation of his location formed around her ears. She rotated her body to try and home in on the sensation, peering through the blackened trees and the mounting smoke, and then saw him creeping towards her. She lost one precious instant in resolving the confusion between her own senses and those of the Crown but used the next to leap out of the way as Avanesh hurled one of Kader\u2019s Boots at her.\r\n\r\nThe Boot was loaded with stones, which spilled out of its throat as it flew. It passed through the child-taker eagle that Sayadaw had used as a mount, trailing stones as it went. The momentum of the stones made a hideous stew of the eagle\u2019s innards. The eagle spent its final, bewildered moments alive lunging and flapping at Avanesh, which saved Sayadaw\u2019s life from being taken in the same manner. He dropped the second Boot, which sank partway into the soil, and brandished a short flint spear he had made. He pierced the eagle\u2019s neck and retracted the spear in a singular smooth motion. As the massive bird crumpled to the ashen floor, Sayadaw\u2019s hand went to her Amulet, her fingers already passingly familiar with the shape of Avanesh\u2019s nerves thanks to the brief altercation that they had shared in the cave. Avanesh threw the spear at Sayadaw and the razor-sharp flint sailed through her linen robe and the meat of her thigh.\r\n\r\nFrom her prison in the dirt, Kader made a yelp of pleading to Avanesh. He gave her a look of disdain and unsheathed Bahadur\u2019s Sword. This time it did not set a forest alight. He aimed the tip at Sayadaw and spoke the first words he had ever directed at her, though she had presented many to him when he was trapped inside the fallen cavern.\r\n\u201CI only want the Crown. Give it to me and I will release you.\u201D\r\n\r\nSayadaw\u2019s finger hovered over the surface of her Amulet. She could interrupt the signals that travelled up and down Avanesh\u2019s body very quickly, but he had tasted this trick before and might be able to resist an assault long enough to strike back. She also did not know how exactly the Sword worked and what it could do to her at this distance. But she did know that Avanesh\u2019s Gloves would give him a good idea of how best to use it.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt belonged to my husband, as did this Sword,\u201D said Avanesh. His fine Gloves looked bright and incongruous against the layer of mud he wore as camouflage underneath the strange coat of leaves. Sayadaw was surprised by this forthcoming elaboration. She supposed that Avanesh had never negotiated from a winning position before. The flow of blood from her leg was making her robes heavy.\r\n\u201CWhat will you do with it?\u201D asked Sayadaw. It worked as a distraction because she was genuinely interested and Avanesh had not spoken to anyone for days.\r\n\u201CI will take them to his family in Susuko,\u201D he said grandly. Sayadaw felt a silent tone around her forehead. The Crown dutifully pointed out the direction to Susuko to her - a muffled shrug towards the southwest, far over the Vibrian Waters.\r\n\u201CWhy?\u201D asked Sayadaw as she shifted her weight over to her good leg.\r\n\u201CThey should pass to his sister, who was the next eldest,\u201D said Avanesh to Sayadaw as if she were simple. She held up her hand to signal acceptance. She unwound the Crown from her head and flung it halfway to Avanesh. It settled near the body of the dead eagle. Sayadaw clasped her wound to staunch the blood.\r\n\r\nThe fires drew closer as Avanesh trod carefully towards Sayadaw. She watched him with one eye. She had gambled her life\u2019s work to win that Crown. She would be ejected with disgrace from the Order of Power and the Order of Vitriol would not welcome her back with open arms. All of her plans had been broken from the moment that Bahadur had drawn that wretched sword on them down in the dark. She had used up all of her resources to mend them.\r\n\r\nThere was something half-tempting about this outcome, as bitter as it was, because the Sword, at least, would be out of reach, as would be the means to find it. If Bahadur\u2019s family had kept it hidden for centuries, it was likely they could manage a century or two more. Without their prize to fight over, the Orders of the Realms would fall back into their usual habits of hoarding relics. Avanesh moved around the eagle and, with the Sword still raised at Sayadaw, bent to pick up the Crown. Their eyes locked as Sayadaw held her thigh in both hands.\r\nShe saw something in his eyes, then said, \u201CIt\u2019s a long way to travel, to reach Susuko,\u201D Avanesh, who had been lost ever since he abandoned Bahadur in the cave, considered this. Slowly, with one hand, he folded the Crown and tied it around his head.\r\n\u201CBahadur\u2019s memory will guide me,\u201D he said with satisfaction. Sayadaw struck with a cobra\u2019s speed.\r\n\u201CWhere did you leave his body to rot?\u201D she asked. Avanesh\u2019s face ran through disbelief to anger but stumbled over the Crown\u2019s insistence on telling him exactly where Bahadur lay - in that miserable sunken cave where Avanesh had bludgeoned him in a desperate bid to save his own hide. Trapped in the cavern of his flooding mind, the Crown showed him Bahadur\u2019s face, just as he\u2019d seen him last. He was, for that wrenching moment, vividly, impossibly alive.\r\n\r\nSayadaw had the open luxury of a moment to bring her hand to her Amulet. Through it, she reached out and tugged on the nerve that connected Avanesh\u2019s spine to his heart. Avanesh lurched, and slurred something that might have been a name as his arms drooped and the Sword fell from his hands. His vision danced with images of Bahadur as he staggered forwards in no particular direction. His brain filled up with bloody foam and he tripped over the remains of the eagle. He did not rise again.\r\n\r\nA smouldering fleece tree fell with a crash nearby. Viper\u2019s Peak would not permit its visitors to stay for much longer. Sayadaw bit down on the disgust she felt whenever she killed someone and limped over to her fading opponent. He paid her no attention. He was too busy with dying and his eyes were fixed on something only he could see; his mouth half curving into an incredulous smile. She removed his Gloves and Crown as the light left him and wore them herself, having no where else to put them. She picked up Kader\u2019s Boots and she took the Sword that had caused everyone so much trouble. The Gloves told her some garbled things about metal that she worked hard to ignore. Kader was saying something so she went over to her trench and realised that there was no good reason to leave her there. She offered her hand and Kader took it. When they touched, Sayadaw was overwhelmed by the signal from the Gloves. Among the noise she realised just how badly Kader had been injured, and how much had been taken from her. With a certain indignation on Kader\u2019s behalf she dragged her from the pit. They held each other up and painfully made their escape.\r\n\r\nThey were both traitors, and so they were both hunted. The sharing of this fostered a comradery that neither of them had known before. With all the world their enemy, Sayadaw let Kader into her private world of ambition. With the Crown they had the means to find the pieces of something incredible. With the Boots they could retrieve those pieces from the deepest hiding place. With the Gloves they could put the pieces back together. Once repaired, they could communicate with the entity with the Amulet. Doing this would completely change the world. And with the Sword, no one could stop them.\r\n\r\n\u2013\r\n\r\nJacky boy\r\n- Master\r\nSing me well\r\n- Very well\r\n\r\nHey, down, ho, down, very very down\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh",

    "\r\nA guide to the Sayadaw Cycle\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nOct 2022\r\nOct 2022\r\n\r\nTicklish\r\n\r\n2\r\nOct '22\r\nTo the readers and the curators, I present to you seven stories that begin as standalone character pieces and quickly become entwined with a fairly complex narrative. I speak of:\r\n\r\n1. Fallen Cavern 6\r\n2. None So Blind 5\r\n3. The Colours of Light 4\r\n4. Sow the Wind 5\r\n5. Fallen Necropolis 3\r\n6. The hunted did a-hunting go 3\r\n7. Reap the Whirlwind 3\r\n\r\nTogether they tell of the life and unlikely rise to infamy of the mage, Spezlaasin Thint Sayadaw.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the order in which they were published is the intended reading order, but this may prove to be an unpopular suggestion. I will straighten the slinky for us all by laying out the events of the stories in chronological order:\r\n\r\nSow the Wind 5 - at some point in the Oligocene, a demon cruiseliner crashes on Earth. It scatters many objects and Loot bags across its surface which will be discovered later by the characters. Its Captain goes down with the Ship. (My two other stories, \u2018Brother, You Are Not Welcome,\u2019 and \u2018The Other Shoe,\u2019 as well as Banners\u2019 story \u2018The Stranger and the Three Fires,\u2019 follow the path of an item that was part of the Ship\u2019s public announcement system.)\r\nThe Colours of Light 4 - much later, Sayadaw is born in the Realm of Spezlaas. As an infant, she learns how to use a magical Ring to see electromagnetic interactions. This Ring was once part of a set of opera glasses for the passengers of the Ship to view the effects that solar flares made on the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere along their journey. Sayadaw is bright and is schooled in a nunnery controlled by the Order of Vitriol. She is taken in by a research assistant, Ozige, who gives her an Amulet. The Amulet was once the communications interface between the Ship and its Captain, but humans only know how to use it as a scarecrow to startle birds. Thanks to Sayadaw\u2019s mastery of the Ring, she can use it to interrupt and sometimes control the nervous systems of other living things. She graduates from her school and is head-hunted by a Wanderer, Odavwaro, from the Order of Power. She leaves with him to further her education among the grand Academies of Light.\r\nFallen Necropolis 3 - some time into the journey from Spezlaas in the far North to the Realm of Hahhukhin, Sayadaw and Odavwaro pass through the Fallen Necropolis near Sukumo. There they discover the Captain, buried in the Loot bag that was the bridge of the Ship. This is retroactively written to be the same location as \u2018Something More Than Loot Itself,\u2019 and Tayv\u2019s sinister tree-throne is said to be the backside of the Captain, a feeding apparatus they had built during their long sleep under the ground. Sayadaw uses her Amulet to try and talk to the Captain but she is not built to receive their messages. Together, she and Odavwaro improvise a way for some limited communication, which opens Sayadaw\u2019s mind to possibilities. Odavwaro decides to keep the entire episode to himself and \u2018gifts\u2019 the buried bag to Sayadaw, though they do not have the resources to excavate it then and there.\r\nReap the Whirlwind (1) 3 - However, after years of training and work for the Order of Power as a Procurer, Sayadaw has the knowledge and the means to dig that Loot bag out of the ground. She interrogates the Captain and is told the strange tale of a Ship that breaks apart, leaving shipwrecked demons, Loot items and bags scattered across the Earth. The Captain begs for her to rebuild the Ship so they may go home. She stashes the bag containing the Captain with Ozige in Spezlaas and decides to investigate this story. Ozige warns her of the dire consequences that could arise from this.\r\nFallen Cavern 6 - after some time, Sayadaw discovers two key Loot items that would be perfect for someone who might want to find all of the parts of a ruined Ship and then put them back together - a Crown for finding things and a pair of Gloves for crafting things. Both items are in the possession of a couple of treasure-hunters, and Sayadaw recruits a warrior of Power, Kader, to help her recover them. She badly batches the job and the wearer of the Gloves, Avanesh, escapes after injuring Kader.\r\nNone So Blind 5 - Following the events of Fallen Cavern, Sayadaw is admonished by her superiors and Kader is fired from the Order. Sayadaw goes alone to retrieve the Crown from the fallen cavern, telling her boss, The Judge of the Reliquary, that she will recover a powerful Sword that the treasure-hunters incongruously were carrying. She gets the Crown, but Kader has been recruited by the Order of Vitriol and steals the Sword from under her nose. This causes Sayadaw to also be fired from the Order of Power.\r\nThe hunted did a-hunting go 3 - Immediately after this, Kader runs into Avanesh in the wilderness near Viper\u2019s Peak and is caught in a trap. Sayadaw rushes in with the help of an eagle mount and cleans up the considerable mess she has made. Avanesh is killed, his Gloves taken, and the Sword is recovered. Kader and Sayadaw join forces as fugitives.\r\nReap the Whirlwind (2) - With the aid of the Gloves and the Crown, Sayadaw speaks again to the Captain and, with nothing left to lose, formulates a plan to rebuild the Ship. Sayadaw, Kader, Ozige and the Captain hunt down several caches of Loot bags, including the one mentioned in \u2018A Cruel Fate,\u2019 raid the Reliquary of Power, and Sayadaw lashes together a partial reconstruction of the lost Ship. On this flying fortress they found the Order of Cataclysm. That can\u2019t be good!\r\nMay this chronological order smooth over any cracks that may arise in the reading experience.\r\n\r\nYour pal,\r\nTicklish",

    "\r\nHoly War Lore | Chapter 2 drafts proposal\r\nWriting\r\nSep 2021\r\nJan 2022\r\n\r\nWMPeaster\r\nSep '21\r\nI crafted this Holy War Lore Ch. 2 draft proposal in building off the narrative and themes put forth in Chapter 1, which has already been put up for a vote on Snapshot 28. This Ch. 2 proposal offers tentative follow-ups for both the \u201CDestroy the Crown\u201D and \u201CPut on the Crown\u201D lore options possible in the Ch. 1 vote. What do you think?\r\n\r\nIf \u201CDestroy the Crown\u201D selected by Loot community, then:\r\n\r\n\u201CI mustn\u2019t,\u201D the enrobed man said.\r\n\r\nWasting no time the hero then gathered the finest spellcasters the mortal realm could spare amid the worsening Great Holy War, and with a terrific midnight ritual returned the captured demon crown to nothingness. Yet hundreds of darkly crowns remained, and the Demon King\u2019s brutal forces were currently making deep advances into the realm\u2019s Outer Districts. Seeded by the enemy\u2019s spies, panic and whispers of defeat began to spread through the ranks of the good-hearted.\r\n\r\nDoom was nigh, but not assured yet. Facing the beginnings of an all-out rout and an age of unimaginable darkness, the divinely-clad hero and other great leaders of the Free World convened an emergency council in the Capital Zone. The gathered captains and sages debated the mortal\u2019s war plan for a half a fortnight; all agreed that field commanders should tactically target demon-crown holders as force multipliers, but what of the war\u2019s greater strategy?\r\n\r\nToward that question two factions quickly broke out. The first faction rallied around calling back all available mortal forces to the Capital Zone, which was vastly more defensible than the Outer and Middle Districts and could reasonably support many refugees for an extended period of time. The second camp argued that the Demon King\u2019s forces should be delayed in the Outer Districts for as long as possible while a small adventurer party was sent to consort with the last living and extremely reclusive Blue Oracle for guidance.\r\n\r\nAt points the discussions became so heated that fighting almost broke out among the heroes, their hearts all in the right yet their minds at odds. With no overwhelming consensus in sight, the mortals decided to discreetly elect via colored pebbles one from among themselves to make the final call. In this way, the Man in the Divine Robe was chosen to lead.\r\n\r\nHe learned of this election and in that moment the man felt like all the gods and all mankind were watching what his lips would do next.\r\n\r\n\u201CShould we retreat to the Capital,\u201D he thought, \u201COr does the Blue Oracle know that path to save the World?\u201D",

Dawn had not yet broken, but a pale light was rising to lap at the brink of morning, and the stars were fading one by one. A single magpie could be seen in the blanching sky. Against the grey half-light, the black and white feathers seem incongruously vibrant. The bird seemed to tear a path through the paper of the sky, leaving fleeting, wing-shaped impressions of something on the other side that was by turns pure black, pure white.\r\n\r\nThis island was ceaseless and horizonless; devoid of hills or mountains. One could travel across its entire breadth and length without walking up or down any sort of incline whatsoever, which was why travellers called it the flatlands, or by its ancient name, The Levelle. The oldest stories about The Levelle spoke of a great demon who rolled the land out flat with his rolling pin and baked bread upon it, the crumbs of which became the first stars. These sorts of antique stories were not well remembered any more by the peoples of this land, and many had been forgotten entirely, along with the ancient songs, although the demons and wildfolk still knew them by heart.\r\n\r\nIn these days, the rulers of the Order of Protection placed a great deal of emphasis on peace and stability, and therefore the people of the Order of Protection did too. They worshipped the God Mooth, the great orator, and considered themselves to be accordingly blessed in the gifts of speech and diplomacy. By the year of Our Lady Antzuma, the Levelle was a nation of stability, well esteemed for its skills in peacekeeping and reconciliation, with ambassadors and advisors well established in almost all corners of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the fourth day of winter finally broke, the morning light spilled out from its bowl in the sky and eventually touched a wild corner of the island, far from the royal castle, where the young crown prince Leif Berraneka was journeying. His hair, when the light touched it, was as pale as boneflower; his eyes reflected perfectly the grey weight of the dawn sky and seemed to hold no colour of their own at all. They were bright with that peculiar, luminous quality that is often seen in the eyes of sleepwalkers or people who are not quite well \u2013 pensive and dreaming by turns, gazing at nothing and everything. Now his face was quite calm and composed, although his eyes glimmered with the unsteady quality of starlight.\r\n\r\nAlthough his complexion and bearing were princely in the highest degree, his dress was somewhat peculiar. He wore the garb of a hunter, though rather badly. His plain hide armour had an enchantment on it that had either been diluted to start with or had faded with age: it glowed queasily in the gloom with its own faint, greenish light. It seemed too large for his slim frame, and as he stood to stretch and gather up his bedroll it was evident that he was clumsy beneath the weight of the chainmail, and moved awkwardly with it. His boots and gloves were dogskin, and at his side hung an unadorned silver sword with the symbol of the Order of Protection at the pommel. Then, alongside these unremarkable \u2013 some might even say unprincely - articles of equipment, he wore an ostentatious filigree crown worked delicately out of real lumin, and dripping with diamonds. The prince\u2019s initials, LB, had been picked out in opals at the front, so there could really be no question of his identity, even though a glance at his features was sufficient to mark him out as a son of Queen Berranek. This crown sat like a beacon on the young prince\u2019s head, glittering his family connections out into the world for all to see. Inexplicably, it held no powers or enchantments whatsoever - neither could it be of any use as an actual helmet, being as delicate and light as a sugar decoration on a wedding cake.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a strange state of affairs, given the dangers of the wild territory that the Prince found himself in, which was home to more demons than humans, and was far from the protection of the castle. It was difficult to fathom but Prince Leif himself appeared unperturbed, and stood gazing westwards with a mild, thoughtful expression towards Wuulwemul as the sun rose.\r\n\r\nHe was not far now from the Mirror Grotto - the lair of the demon Rojin and the great store of treasure that it hoarded there. Among the riches, fiercely guarded, were rumoured to be a number of Divine Relics \u2013 the name given in that land to items bestowed with rare and mysterious power. The Prince himself, it should be mentioned, was in possession of one such Divine Relic, which had been bequeathed to him by the Queen Antova on the day he came of age. It was an Amulet of Protection; a golden locket in the shape of two cupped hands hanging on a golden chain around Leif\u2019s neck. This amulet, contrary to its name, did not afford the young Prince any form of protection at all, but was blessed with the curious trick of being able to magic into existence an endless supply of seeds of the royal tree of the Order of Protection. The existence of this Divine Relic and its possession by the royal family of the Order of Protection perhaps explained the family\u2019s ancient pledge to shade the land and feed the people, which the holding of this relic neatly fulfilled. Prince Leif unclasped the locket now, and although the amulet would not have rattled had it been shaken, a small reddish brown nut now sat in the hollow of the golden hands. He lifted it to his lips, kissed it, and stooped to plant it in the soil at his feet.\r\n\r\nRoyal pledge fulfilled, the Prince straightened to gather his knapsack, and saw the magpie. It was perched on a low branch of a nearby lanya tree, and although it had been assiduously wiping its beak on a cluster of leaves before, it now stopped as if embarrassed, and, turning its head aside, looked narrowly at the Prince with one bright berry-black eye.\r\n\r\n\u201CGood morning, master magpie!\u201D said Leif, mostly to himself. It was considered good luck on the island to greet a magpie when you saw one \u2013 this was an old folk tradition, the origins of which had been lost to time.\r\n\r\nThe magpie ignored him. It was looking at his crown now. It turned its head to the other side in order to assess the sparkling edifice more properly with its right eye, and then cocked its head again to inspect it with the left. It craned its neck to get a better view. It leaned forward on its branch and stared, its beak slightly open and its eyes bright with diamonds, until Leif broke out laughing.\r\n\r\nThis startled the bird briefly into flight \u2013 its wingbeat, stammering, tattooed the air between them with bands of black and white which resolved when the bird landed in the velvet shade of the lanya tree\u2019s upper branches.\r\n\r\n\u201CSorry,\u201D Leif said, half laughing. \u201CAren\u2019t you beautiful! What would you like?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe magpie peered down at him.\r\n\r\n\u201CWould you like something to eat? Here, have this! And keep me from bad luck, won\u2019t you?\u201D Smiling, he took a second nut from the little golden amulet and tossed it to the ground beneath the tree.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high enough now to travel by; he would easily reach the Grotto by evening. There was treasure to be retrieved and a powerful guardian to be reckoned with - and if the demon Rojin was as fierce as the stories suggested then Leif would need all the good luck he could get. If the thought of this coming battle troubled him at all, it did not show. The young Crown Prince, as he wandered westwards, could be heard singing a hymn under his breath \u2013 his eyes were the colour of the wide sky, his expression mild and far-off, as if he were remembering a place from his childhood as he sang.\r\n\r\nVeil thee with many veils,\r\n\r\nIt hideth not your fire\r\n\r\nBut rouseth thee to bright desire\r\n\r\nTo speak thy sacred tales.\r\n\r\nA faint clapping of wings could be heard. Back at the lanya tree, the magpie flew to the ground in a zoetropic stutter of black and white, and somewhere between the sky and the earth it found a new shape and became something else. The pale sun continued to rise; the air was quite still and cold. In the deep shade at the foot of the tree stood now the demon Rojin, dressed in a cloak of black and white feathers. They stooped briefly, and when they rose they held between their thumb and forefinger a nut of the royal tree of the Order of Protection. They held it up to their black eyes and examined it closely. They looked at the retreating shape of the Prince in the distance, and smiled hungrily, showing all of their teeth.}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

The bag reportedly contained a range of \u201Cmagical items\u201D, including a Robe, that Laklo frothily described as \u201Crare\u201D and \u201CDivine\u201D, gloves, presumably made of dragonskin, a ring, made of Titanium, which Laklo characterized as \u201Cabsolutely perfect\u201D, and a wand made of what appears to be bones of canine origin, such as a wolf or a fox, though Laklo inexplicably insists on it being \u201Cclearly of the Fox\u201D. The bag contained some other items which this report will not bother to expand on, as we shall find that the nature of the items is anything but what Laklo claims they are, and we have a more parsimonious explanation for the bizarre series of events that did indeed seem to occur on that day.\r\n\r\nRobe: This report does not deny the existence of so-called \u201Cmagical robes\u201D, even though the vast majority of them are nothing more than expensive and ostentatious clothing. This is not the case with the Robe in question, which is in fact a genuine article of magical power. It is not, however, a particularly powerful item, and its effects are mostly limited to making the wearer look more attractive and commanding.\r\n\r\nGloves: These are, as Laklo correctly surmised, made of dragonskin, and are thus quite valuable. They are not, however, magical, and their only purpose is to protect the hands of the wearer from cold weather.\r\n\r\nRing: This is indeed a titanium ring, yet we do not share the assessment of \u201Cperfection\u201D, given the limited epistemological meaningfulness of such an assessment.\r\n\r\nAs for the events that followed Laklo\u2019s discovery, we will first attempt to summarize these from a purely perceptual point of view, in other words, as it must have appeared to the rather simple minds of the witnesses on that day.\r\n\r\nUpon opening the bag, Laklo first took out the ring and put it on his finger. He then proceeded to put the Robe on, and take out the bone wand, at which point he said some words in a language that no one present could understand. Laklo then appeared to have started to emanate a sort of glow, and his eyes turned \u201Corange\u201D. He then levitated off the ground and started to float around the area of the pond.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of those who witnessed these events, it would have appeared as if Laklo had indeed discovered a bag of magical items, and that these items had imbued him with magical powers.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must remember that Laklo is a known pathological liar, and that he has been known to invent stories in order to garner attention. In light of this, it is more likely that Laklo simply put on a show, using mundane items to create the illusion of magical powers.\r\n\r\nThe most likely explanation for the glowing and levitation is that Laklo used some kind of light source, such as a lantern, to create the illusion of magical powers. As for the orange eyes, this is most likely due to Laklo wearing paint on his eyelids.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that Laklo\u2019s story changes depending on who he is speaking to. For example, he told the farmers that the Robe made him feel \u201Cdivine and special\", as if he \"had been granted special access to commune with others of similar standing\u201D, yet he told the Elders that the Robe made him feel \u201Cas if I could fly\u201D. It is clear that Laklo is simply making up stories as he goes along, and that he is not to be believed.\r\n\r\nFurther, Laklo has no magical experience or credentials whatsoever, and is not registered with any known guild of sorcery within the Realm, so even if he had indeed found a bag of magical items, it is inconceivable that he would have any idea how to use them.\r\n\r\nWe should also not make the mistake of not carefully examining the merit of our witnesses, as they are, for the most part, farmers with little to no education, and whose testimony must thus be taken with a grain of salt. For example, the shepherd R\u00F6plin Hlarbert, when questioned by Master Flolol\u00F6men on the very evening of the day of the event, was unaware of the role of The Archive\u2019s Elders, and mistook Master Flolol\u00F6men for a \u201Cscribe or a monk\". His wife, L\u00EFsbren Hlarbert, even called Master Flolol\u00F6men a \u201Cmoronic codger\u201D when he found her to be completely unable to bring her outrageous testimony in line with the Third Ontic Principle. Their boy, F\u00EBrdin Hlarbert, was the only one of the three who seemed to be telling the truth with respect to a complete absence of magic in the matter, though his testimony is nevertheless too confused to be of investigative value, claiming that Laklo\u2019s \u201Cfloating around\u201D did indeed not involve anything magical, as he was \u201Csimply flying like birds do, which have no magic to them either\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is the opinion of this report that the events of Middleday the Fifteenth, as related by Hr\u00EBnd Laklo and witnesses, are to be considered apocryphal, and that the items in question are nothing more than mostly mundane objects with negligible magical powers. This report therefore recommends that no further public investigation be made into the matter of the event itself, and the items be kept in the Archive\u2019s vault to avoid any further mischaracterization of their nature.\r\n\r\nLastly, and unfortunately, it must be noted that some items seem to have been stolen or lost in the aftermath of the investigation. Specifically, the bone wand, the robe and the ring seem to have gone missing sometime between the original event and the subsequent delivery of the entire bag to the Archive by Master Flolol\u00F6men. It is our opinion that they were clearly stolen by one of the witnesses or even Hr\u00EBnd Laklo himself, which is further corroborated by the fact that Laklo seems to have gone missing himself after his interrogation. We recommend that a search be made for Hr\u00EBnd Laklo and the missing items, and that he be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law if found guilty of theft.\r\n}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

Ping, a lesser god, living a lesser life in the lesser town of Amosen, went about his day doing what many lesser gods would do, nothing.\r\n\r\nIt should have been obvious when the loons arrived, and their ominous wail rang out across the land. The gods of Amosen paid little mind to the calls of the birds, and continued innocently through their days, unaware that dusk had finally arrived. A single orb opened in the center of town, and through it stepped the First God of War. Soon the orbs would cover all the land, and legions of war-hungry gods would rattle out their own battle cry and the loons would be heard no more.\r\n\r\nBut, let us not get ahead of ourselves. As the First God of War\u2019s boot hit the ground, a smile, wide and full of teeth, stretched across his face. The First God laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou there, what is your name?\u201D A question full of mirth echoed loud across Amosen.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name is Ping.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPing.\u201D The First God rolled the name around in his mouth, \u201Cyes, well, Ping, today is your lucky day. This shithole you call a town is going to become a town of legend. Songs will be sung, banners will be made, and stories will be retold for all of time. You are so very lucky!\u201D\r\n\r\nPing did not feel lucky\u2026 the entire town of Amosen didn\u2019t feel lucky. In fact, the complete opposite of luck was the shared feeling that day. But, as with all things, the strong come, and the strong control, and the strong change everything.\r\n\r\nAll of the gods have power, from lowliest to the mightiest, and those powers which laid dormant in Amosen for so very long would once again awaken.\r\n\r\n\u201CPing, please, come here,\u201D the First God ordered. \u201CI\u2019m told you\u2019re very clever at the molding of metals.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAye, tis true, but no more than all us fellows of the forge. Our weapons seem to meet the approval of all their wielders,\u201D Ping said as he took off his worn gloves and met the eyes of the First.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, so modest, little Ping. But no, I hear you are different. You might just be capable of this task.\u201D The First pulled out a strange metal from his satchel, and handed it over to Ping. \u201CI need you, Ping, to make me a crown.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat is this? This is not, it can\u2019t be\u2026 Where did you find this?\u201D Ping\u2019s voice quivered out the questions.\r\n\r\n\u201CAh Ping, so many questions. The Day of Fire is coming soon, and I will be there to greet it, with your magnificent creation upon my head.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs Ping stared down at the strange metal, he could feel the pull\u2026the drawing in of himself. The metal was hungry for him.\r\n\r\nPing burst into the forge, short of breath as he croaked out in a voice the others had not heard before, \u201CWomen and men of the forge, come forward. I need all of our strength. Today we strike the void, and bend all of time to our will.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn the heat and glow of the forge the mallets slammed while the gods sang. For 3 days they labored, until it was time for Ping to whisper his magic words and bind his will forever to the crown. The stone was set.\r\n\r\nPing carried the crown as the fellows of the forge followed, and as he lifted the crown toward the First God, he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\u201CPing, look at you, and look at this magnificent creation.\u201D The First reached out and firmly pulled the crown from Ping\u2019s grasp.

Those two realms bordered each other at Saltbane Point, a hazard-laden stretch of water that had claimed skilled maritimers who sailed too close. That account had come from a chatty barmaid at the Long Shot tavern in bek-Rim. bek-Rim was set inland at the end of a long inlet and looked like a quaint little fishing town, though its banner had two weapons. Lohmen recorded the house of Trident Catapult Morning Star on a green field with black trim into his tome. As the barmaid told it, large timbers from the surrounding forests were worked and formed to make the namesake war machines that were sought by armies from all over the continent. A quaint little fishing town with a booming industry of destruction nestled within. The sage snapper Lohmen ordered didn\u2019t last as long as the oral history from the barmaid, but Lohmen found the story captivating. With a full belly and a new tale to think about on his travels, Lohmen left and was back to illumination.\r\n\r\n<> <> <>\r\n\r\nIt must be close. She said it was in the valley around here.\r\n\r\nLohmen trotted along the dusty trail and a town of sorts came out of hiding behind a ridge. Just like the barmaid in bek-Rim had promised, Kisilimli wasn\u2019t so much a town, but more of a campsite. The inland village was a stunningly broad collection of yurts only appreciated fully by soaring birds. His subject, the Banner of Fire Horse Fire, waved at him from a thick standard driven into the ground. Were it not for that, this place wouldn\u2019t have had a definitive entrance at all.\r\n\r\n\u201CHello!\u201D said a happy child, around nine or ten years old, as he approached Lohmen.\r\n\r\n\u201CHello. I believe I\u2019ve arrived at the House of Fire Horse Fire. Is that correct?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes! Though we name ourselves Horse Two-Fires.\u201D The young boy inspected Lohmen, his horse, and his bags as they exchanged pleasantries.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is an ancient house, right?\u201D Lohmen recalled reading about the ancient banners as a child. Any house bearing only animals and items of the earth were the oldest houses, some with history dating back thousands of years.\r\n\r\n\u201CYesser, here since the strangers. And long before the mythical or weapon houses.\u201D He made a disapproving look as he mentioned the more modern banners.\r\n\r\nLohmen recognized that look. Kahriah had the same disdain for the houses of the sixteen orders. He started, \u201CMy wi\u2013\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs she with you, too?\u201D The question came before Lohmen could finish. The childlike innocence cut through him like a dagger.\r\n\r\n\u201CJust me today. But say, I\u2019d like to paint your banner in my book, if that\u2019s all right?\u201D Then he added, \u201Cand I\u2019ll be sure to mark its ancient status.\u201D Lohmen smiled, and then reminded himself of warnings about keeping the tome hidden.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019s just a boy.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, yes, but make sure to capture the pride of the horse. I\u2019ll inspect your work when you\u2019re done if you like.\u201D The boy was delightfully precocious. Lohmen took a deep breath through his nose to abate emotion.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho should I ask for when I\u2019m done?\u201D Lohmen played along, forcing a smile despite enjoying the banter.\r\n\r\n\u201CMy name\u2019s MoShar.\u201D Before Lohmen could say anything else, the boy took off with a pack of other children darting through the yurts.\r\n\r\nThe house of Fire Horse Fire was his first ancient banner, and given its place on the standard, the first one he could see up close. There was no wear or fray. He tried to recall the previous thirty banners, but they had been hung much higher on town and city gates. He didn\u2019t remember any wear or age, but it hadn\u2019t become apparent until he ran one through his fingers.\r\n\r\nPeculiar.\r\n\r\nWith no stones or gates to sit on or lean against, Lohmen sat cross-legged in front of the standard and prepared his tools. An hour later, he lowered his brush and blew softly onto the tome and its thirty-first addition, which yielded a proud smile on the face of its creator. He picked up the brush and added one more feature to the horse: a slight bend in his brow to signify the determined pride that MoShar had required.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for his work to dry, he did some basic arithmetic in his head.\r\n\r\nBanner thirty-one\u2026of twenty-five thousand. I\u2019ve been on the road for six days\u2026\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s going to take\u2026five thousand days to paint them all\u2026? That can\u2019t be right.\r\n\r\nHis jaw dropped; the promised sum suddenly seemed quite paltry.\r\n\r\nTomeera had said there was no time to waste, but it hardly made sense to rush such a grand task. He pondered her haste while he closed the tome and slid it safely back into his tomesack. Lohmen had settled into an old routine: reconnaissance under the guise of dining post-illumination.\r\n\r\nEvery banner is one step closer to Thesdon.\r\n\r\nAnd Kahriah.\r\n\r\nAnd Tolo.\r\n\r\nThe community didn\u2019t have a book binder or a tavern, nor any discernible buildings; just the circles of yurts. They were arranged around a core, and there, he found a massive fountain-like structure that would look at home in even the grandest of cities. It wasn\u2019t carved from marble or twilight quartz, but made from countless stones of varying sizes, skillfully arranged into a communal structure. And it wasn\u2019t water in the fountain: it was fire. Not a giant inferno, but a collection of many low fires burning independently of each other.\r\n\r\nBuilt into the circular structure were several inlets furnished with everything from metal grates to flat rocks and spits, ready to roast the spoils of a successful hunt or harvest.\r\n\r\nStrewn around the fire-fountain, thick stumps of wood were used as chairs and tables. Beyond the stumps, a set of posts were driven into the ground with short pieces lashed across them. Lohmen saw a horse tied to one on the opposite side of the fire-fountain and did the same with his own.\r\n\r\nAn old woman sat by herself on a stump and gestured to the one beside her. She smiled and he sat, placing his tomesack in his lap. \u201CI\u2019m Lohmen.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is nice to meet you, Lohmen. I am Shar.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CKisilimli is beautiful. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201D The woman smiled in response, her wise eyes disappearing under old skin.\r\n\r\nThe painter dispensed with the pleasantries. \u201CI\u2019m looking for my son. He disappeared five years ago in Umlom. Do you remember hearing of it?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CFive years is a long time, child.\u201D She went on slowly,\r\n\r\n\u201CWhy do you only search now? Umlom is not far.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a long story.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see. I did not hear of a missing boy, but I will ask my cousins in the house of Three Fires. They live quite far, but we have means to converse.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat kind of means?\u201D Lohmen was genuinely curious.\r\n\r\n\u201CI cannot say, nor would you understand if I did.\u201D She went on, \u201CWhen you come upon a house of fire, ask for news of Umlom and they will tell you if there is anything to know.\u201D Lohmen pondered this, but wasn\u2019t convinced. Shar picked up his scepticism and laughed.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe cannot see visions in the flames, Lohmen. Do not worry. Though we are an ancient people, we were not the first. We are descendants of the house of Three Fires. It has existed since creation itself. They live on a Continent of Detection, as you might know it, but that is a more modern name.\u201D\r\n\r\nLohmen cursed himself for getting into a conversation that began at the dawn of time with an old woman, but he paid attention to learn more about conversing over great distances.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Three Fires have burned since the beginning and were lit by the sun itself.\u201D Pride of history beamed through her voice.\r\n\r\n\u201COne day, a thousand years ago, there was a violent tempest. It raged hard, but was not long. When the clouds cleared, a flame had been snuffed for the first time. It was the same day they found a stranger washed up on the shore. He had no clothes, no weapons or possessions. Not even a name. The Three Fires took the stranger in and treated him as one of their own.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the third flame would not light. They tried different woods. Different oils. They tried praying to the sun gods. Nothing would relight the third flame.\u201D\r\n\r\nLohmen looked up as a boy brought a large dish of meat and root vegetables and Shar offered some to Lohmen. The arrival of food made the woman\u2019s story more interesting all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe stranger stayed with the Three Flames, though many believed the extinguished fire was his fault. Soon they came to blame him for any misfortunes that befell the village. What else could it be?\r\n\r\n\u201CThen, one day, a brave little girl dove into the waters near his landing and retrieved a bag from the sea floor. She brought it to the inner fire and showed it to the flamekeepers. They did not know what to make of it, but the stranger saw it and told them it belonged to him. He did not know why; he only knew.\r\n\r\n\u201CThey allowed him to dress in its contents. When he put them on, they fit as if they were made just for him. When he hung his blade on his belt, the third flame re-ignited.\u201D\r\n\r\nLohmen smiled as he ate, but was failing to see any relevance.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe stranger had become one of the people, received the kiss of the coals, and stayed for a time. When dressed in the things from the bag of the sea, he developed strange new abilities. That was when we learned to communicate over great distances. And short.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut the stranger did not stay. The world beckoned him. Some people travelled with him as he crossed the realms. Some settled along the way. That is how we are here.\u201D She smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s very interesting. I look forward to visiting the house of Three Fires someday.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe hardened her gaze.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do not listen, Lohmen. They were searching for answers at the flame itself. Just like you search for clues and disturb the meals of old women.\u201D\r\n\r\nLohmen took another bite and thought.\r\n\r\nBut they didn\u2019t know they were looking for a bag; the girl just happened upon it.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut if they had searched where the stranger landed like the girl did, they\u2019d have lit the third flame more quickly. Where did your mystery start, Lohmen?\u201D Her face softened as she leaned back.\r\n\r\nLohmen stopped chewing.\r\n\r\nHow did she do that?\r\n\r\n\u201CI told you that you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201D\r\n\r\nLohmen sat silently and ate, trying not to think anything ill of the woman. He thought of his son and the years he had spent looking before the commission letter had come.\r\n\r\n\u201CMaybe you have more than one mystery.\u201D She propounded.\r\n\r\nHe thanked her and stood. She refused his offer of coin, and the boy who had brought the food was nowhere to be found. Lohmen walked to the fire and picked up a cold piece of charcoal well away from the flames. On a page torn from his cartography notebook, he sketched the harmonious scene at the fire fountain, the old woman appearing in the foreground wise and smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201CI will cherish this, Lohmen,\u201D she said when he gave it to her. \u201CThank you. May the fire be your friend.\u201D He nodded and left her to finish the meal. A cough came from near the woman. MoShar looked at him with raised eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\u201CRight, of course!\u201D He pulled out the tome and held it on display for inspection.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery good. I like how you captured the eyes. Where will you go now, Painter?\u201D the boy asked.\r\nLohmen smiled at him with sad eyes before stowing the tome away. The question hung on him for a moment before he answered.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not entirely sure yet, but I\u2019m going to go see a book binder.\u201D\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

The spider yawned as the adventurer cautiously stepped forward and tapped the ground lightly as if testing the integrity of the earth itself. On one side of the path was the cavern wall, the other a bottomless abyss. With each footstep the unsuspecting adventurer inched closer to the trap they had set for him. The crunching of each cautious footstep echoed through the cavern and began to annoy the duo. It seemed as if the adventurer\u2019s pace slowed with each step. The once eager pair were filled with excitement in anticipation to see yet another adventurer succumb to the traps and treachery of the cavern. However, this particular adventurer\u2019s cautious disposition had replaced that excitement with annoyance.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis is taking forever\u2026 he should have hit the trap already\u201D whispered Spinnekop.\r\n\r\nForvitinn offered \u201CI could float over and scare him to speed him up.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo. I personally feel much more entertained when it happens naturally. Don\u2019t forget, you bet me five flies and a small mouse he would miss the trap. They always hit the trap.\u201D The spider began to spin a web to occupy itself from boredom.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you like the flies that much? Honestly, I thought you were joking about the mouse\u2026a-a-are you going to eat it?\u201D The dimly lit sphere shaped spirit turned toward the web which was nearly complete. Its face had two dimmed closely positioned circular sockets that served as eyes and a round mouth that never shut. Because of the proximity of its features it appeared as if the spirit were in a constant state of awe.\r\n\r\nThe spider paused for a moment to hang upside-down from its web, \u201CIn fact I do like flies very much. Eat the mouse? Oh I would never do that\u2026I was more thinking about keeping it as a pet. What do you think of me Forvee? A monster?\u201D the spider curiously hissed.\r\n\r\nForvee glared at the jade spider in disbelief. \u201CFor a spider, you really are odd.\u201D\r\n\r\nRoughly the size of a common street cat the spider was an imposing size for an arachnid. It leisurely rotated on the thread of web towards the spirit until its eight violet eyes locked with the two empty sockets. \u201CFirstly, immortal spider. The distinction is important. Besides, I told you that I think mice are delightful creatures because they have only two cute little dark eyes.\u201D The spider turned away to hide its delight in the idea of owning a pet mouse. Rotating back towards Forvee it continued explaining \u201CIt can\u2019t really hurt me since I can\u2019t die\u2026 because I am immortal\u2026 so maybe I train it to bring me stuff.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSpinny!\u2026Shhh. You talk too much\u2026he is about to get to the trap door\u201D the pale spirit responded. They both turned and watched the nearly motionless adventurer move half an inch forward.\r\n\r\n\u201CI really hate this guy\u201D muttered Spinny. Forvee nodded in agreement.\r\n\r\nIt was by mere circumstance and by proximity that the two unlikely pair became friends through their joy of watching adventurers perish in the Stygian Cavern. Admittedly, even this entertainment had begin to wane as they had seen every variation of an adventurer meet their end. Both were cursed to spend an eternity maintaining the traps and to lead unsuspecting adventurers to their untimely demise. Their original mandate long forgotten with the passage of time. Routine had overtaken their days and with it boredom.\r\n\r\nNeither were strangers to observing the adventurers who sought the treasures which rest within the belly of the cavern. They had seen many a weary adventurer enter but never leave this treacherous cavernous trap. The adventurer took one more micro step forward as his torch began to flicker and dim.\r\n\r\nForvee uttered, \u201CI wish I could die of old age. This is unbearable watching him. It\u2019s not like he is going to make it to the treasure.\u201D\r\n\r\nSpinny slowly turned toward Forvee and lifted its claw. \u201CWhat if we help this guy find the treasure.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe cave spirit dismissed quickly \u201CAre you daft?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo wait, hear me out\u2026we always watch these guys fall through the trap door, get shot by the arrows in the next area or get sliced in half by the swinging pendulum when they get towards the end. And we always reset everything for the next adventurer to wander in the next week. Why do we even reset the traps each week?\u201D\r\n\r\nWith a clueless resolve Forvee said \u201CTo make it fair for the next one? If I were a dead adventurer I would be furious that I made it easier for the next fellow.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe spider stared stupidly at the cave spirit as if to mock him.\r\n\r\n\u201CFairness? You yaldson. We were cursed to do this.\u201D Looking up and to the right, the spirit recognized this all too familiar expression of nostalgia overcome the spider as it began its monologue. \u201CI was merely a simple shepherd tending to my flock of sheep. I led a quiet life and lived off the land without a sorrow or need in the world.\" The spirit began to mouth the spider\u2019s words mockingly. \u201CIt has been so many ages that I have been trapped in this form that I have forgotten my own appearance. This cavern is all I know now. All this because because that warlock turned me into this bucket sized spider for refusing to sell him my favorite sheep\u2026 Woolma.\u201D\r\n\r\nPausing for a moment, the spider exclaimed \"Why do we even protect that cumberworld warklock\u2019s treasure? I don\u2019t even remember his name or why we need to protect it. He said something like protect \u2026 something\u2026I forgot what the one important piece of the treasure looks like. What good is loot to a spider or a spirit?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe spider gracefully leapt from its web next to floating phantasm. \u201CHe seemed pretty important back then but I am fairly certain he is dead as he was decrepit looking all those years ago. I bet he is not immortal as he had difficulty getting around. I suppose he could have just become a spider but maybe being dead is better than being an immortal spider. Or so he thought\u2026that\u2019s kinda depressing now that I think about it.\u201D\r\n\r\nTrying to snap his friend back to reality, \u201CSpinny you really are a loquacious crawler. Unlike you, I don\u2019t remember my past. I remember awakening and the warlock being there. He taught me how to set the traps and some simple magic but I don\u2019t remember anything else. I have always wanted to leave the cavern in hopes of learning more about myself but we can\u2019t pass by the magical barrier.\u201D The warlock entrapped the spider and the spirit by placing a seal on the cavern\u2019s entrance that prevented them from escaping.\r\n\r\nResigning themselves to the familiar acceptance of their fate the spirit casually mentioned \u201CWatching these simple minded adventurers die each week gets deathly boring. Who knows, maybe if they get the treasure it breaks the curse because there is nothing for us to protect?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe shared epiphany struck light a bolt of lightning. They both slowly turned towards each other with new resolve. Forvee excitedly said \u201CI\u2019ll go introduce myself to the adventurer. I\u2019ll say I am a friendly cave spirit.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CSince when are cave spirits friendly?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CStarting now?\u201D\r\n\r\nWith a shrug the spider resigned itself to the stupidity of the idea. \u201CIt\u2019s worth a shot. Good luck. Don\u2019t scare him to death.\u201D\r\n\r\nForvee floated gracefully outside the frozen adventurer\u2019s line of sight and floated momentarily above his head. Like a deflating balloon Forvee slowly descended until directly behind the adventurer and whispered \u201CGreetings friend. Do not fear for I am a \u2018friendly\u2019 spirit of the cave. I\u2019m here to - \u201C\r\n\r\nBefore Forvee had an opportunity to finish the terrified the adventurer leaped in the air and dropped his torch. The adventurer fumbled and strained to unsheathe his sword and the spirit looked on awkwardly at this exercise in futility.\r\n\r\nOvercome with desperation, the adventurer\u2019s backed away from the spirit drawing closer and closer to the trapdoor. Meanwhile, the torch flickered and gave its last breath filling the air with smoke. The unending darkness clouded the adventurer\u2019s senses and panic gripped his heart. Forvee began to give off a soft moonlight glow. The sword unsheathed and a loud cry burst forth from the adventurer trembling lips \u201CSTAY BACK FOUL SPIRIT. I SHALL VANQUISH THEEEEEE.\u201D His heart racing and his lungs empty.\r\n\r\nThe adventurer sliced through the clueless orb to no effect. They both stared at one another unsure what to do. The empty sockets staring aimlessly at the adventurer. Forvee finished its sentence \u201Chelp\u2026I\u2019m here to help. There is a trap door behind you. I know because I helped set it.\u201D The spirit floated toward the torch and lifted it slowly. For a moment the spirit\u2019s sockets glowed a deep fiery orange and the torch ignited with a fantastic bright flame.\r\n\r\n\u201CHere, this won\u2019t fizzle out. Take it and may it light your path sluggish adventurer.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe adventurer was confused but with one trembling hand gripping his blade he reached out with his free hand for the brilliant torch. He gripped it tightly and pulled back quickly, turning to see the trap door mere inches away from his position.\r\n\r\nWith quivering lips the wide-eyed adventurer looked at the expressionless spirit \u201CYou\u2026you saved me?\u201D\r\n\r\nIn a moment of brief yet woefully inept contemplation the spirit flatly replied, \u201CWell\u2026 I suppose if you look at it that way I can understand how it may \u2019appear\u2019 to you that I saved you but it isn\u2019t because I like you. I actually had a bet with Spinny earlier regarding your untimely demi-\u2026\u201D abruptly catching itself mid-word as it felt the eight violet glimmering eyes hanging from the cavern\u2019s ceiling pierce its formless soul.\r\n\r\nA quick whisper darted from above \u201CShut up you fopdoodle. You\u2019ll give away our plan.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe arachnid lowered itself menacingly from above on its silky shimmering thread behind the stunned adventurer. The reflection of the flickering fire made its eyes glow like embers as it nonchalantly hissed \u201CWe need you alive to test a theory. You haven\u2019t really got an option if you wish to survive this treacherous place.\u201D\r\n\r\n{part 2\u2026 in the works!}",

Very little was known about it, partly due to the wild remoteness of the region and partly due to the density and great variety of the demon population there, who deterred most travellers and ate the rest. The earliest historical account of the place is also the most detailed \u2013 a short passage in Phasros the Elder\u2019s Vestigo, reading:\r\n\r\n\u201COf the so-called grotto of mirrors near Ninnolzhew, which may be the same wonder as the Knoll of Bones, it is said to be a demon-made construction taking the shape of a low hillock upon the landscape, the inside of which is lined with splendour and the outer with gore.\u201D\r\n\r\nMost later texts do not mention it at all, although there is mention made in an old song of that region which mentions \u201Cyon shyning hill of bones,\u201D which likely refers to the place, there being no real hills or mountains in that region at all. It does not feature on the majority of maps, lacking the extraordinary usefulness of The Exalted Basin, or the tragic history of The Exalted Maple.\r\n\r\nHow Prince Leif Berranek had managed to make it there unscathed was anyone\u2019s guess. His armour was mismatched and poorly made, his sword was dull, and yet he carried with him an astonishingly rare map from the library of the royal family, printed on demonskin. This map, strange to say, had been gifted to him personally by the very same royal personages who had seen fit to send him out into the world wearing dogskin gloves. It depicted the island in wonderful detail, accurately charting a number of regions that were thought to be entirely uncharted, among them Juwnedon-Wek, the realm of the Mirror Grotto. The map had been marked for him to show the reported locations of a number of Divine Relics - those rare and curious pieces of equipment that were sought by all those who sought power, and which granted their bearers strange, wonderful gifts.\r\n\r\nPrince Leif stood just a few paces now from the Grotto, dressed in his strange garb and bejewelled crown. He consulted the demonskin map one last time. The wonder had been depicted as a low mound, and a small golden X had been painted on to indicate the presence there of a possible Divine Relic. In black ink above the mound was another tiny symbol \u2013 a six fingered hand, the mark used to denote the presence of a great demon.\r\n\r\nLeif put the map away and looked the grotto. Phasros the Elder\u2019s Vestigo and the map had both depicted the grotto as a sort of hillock, but both sources were ancient. The Mirror Grotto had grown since those days. It jutted up into the sky now like a giant skeletal thumb, pale against the pale sky. It had looked uniformly white from a distance, but now that he was closer Leif saw the innumerable bones and skulls and ossicles that had been picked clean and pressed into the walls of the structure. The bones near the bottom of the towering structure had bleached white in the sun, but those nearer the top were newer, and were dark with blood. Above, a magpie circled.\r\n\r\nNo demon came to tear him limb from limb as Leif approached: no challenge answered his tentative, questioning call. Still, it was with great trepidation that he entered the grotto, almost holding his breath as he stepped through a doorway that no living creature but the demon Rojin had passed through for centuries.\r\n\r\nIt was cool inside, and quite silent. The high walls reached up to an open circle of sky far above through which the light poured in, breaking itself on the way down into a thousand points of brilliance, for the walls of the grotto were lined with glittering treasures from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nSo kaleidoscopic and dazzling was this effect that it took some time for Leif\u2019s eyes to adjust, and then with a racing heart he stepped further in and began to gaze around in search of something resembling a Divine Relic. Here, he began to have his first misgivings. On closer inspection, the items lining the walls did not appear to be treasures at all, but rather a large collection of carefully curated pieces of rubbish.\r\n\r\nThere was a pair of broken spectacles, with a crack across one of the lenses. There were innumerable pieces of magenta and turquoise coloured glass \u2013 the hues commonly used in that region for ale and rootwine bottles. There were shards of mirrors, and not only shards but entire hand mirrors, wall mirrors, and (Leif shuddered to see) hundreds upon hundreds of traditional handheld demonglasses. These relics were commonly carried by villagers and poorfolk, and consisted of a piece of smoked mirror set in a little embroidered frame at the end of a stick \u2013 it was believed that they warded off demons. They clearly had not warded off the demon Rojin, who had plucked these mirrors from the bodies of the villagers he had killed, and had been setting them in the walls of his grotto for centuries. The demonglasses nearer the bottom of the walls were quite ancient: their mirrors were hexagonal instead of circular, and the surface of the mirrors were engraved with words in the old language, a practice which had died out more than two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nLeif stood on tiptoe and craned his neck to get a better look at the items higher up. Beetle wings; tin foil; silverware; what looked like a great cracked lighthouse lens. And as Leif stared in growing dismay, a dark shadow fell across the entrance to the grotto.\r\n\r\nThere in the entranceway stood the great demon Rojin themselves, in the form of a giant magpie. This shape of theirs was so large that they could not even fit their head through the doorway of the grotto: instead they stooped and pressed their enormous eye against the entrance to peer in.\r\n\r\nLeif, trembling from head to toe, drew his sword and promptly dropped it.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhoops,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, well, well. What do we have here?\u201D said the magpie. The demon\u2019s enormous eye almost filled the entirety of the doorway. Leif backed himself up hastily against the furthest wall, and tried to think of something to say.\r\n\r\n\u201CI am Prince Leif,\u201D he said at last, for it seemed as if the magpie really was awaiting an answer. \u201CPrince Leif Berranek, of the royal house of the Order of Protection.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CA prince!\u201D The great eye scrutinised him in silence for a bit.\r\n\r\n\u201CI like your grotto,\u201D said Leif, weakly.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh yes! Yes\u2026 there\u2019s ever such a lot here, isn\u2019t there? Gosh. And er, the decoration. Is it all\u2026 er\u2026 This sort of thing?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat sort of thing?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBottles? Bits of glass and such?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe eye at the entrance narrowed.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell!\u201D said Leif, nervously. \u201CIt\u2019s all marvellous, I must say. Jolly good stuff. Lovely bottles.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI collected it all myself,\u201D said the demon Rojin.\r\n\r\n\u201CGoodness! Well! My word!\u201D Leif cleared his throat awkwardly. \u201CIs - is there anything more powerful here, perhaps? My map said there might be-\u201C\r\n\r\n\u201CI have spec-a-tacles,\u201D said Rojin modestly. \u201CMany pairs. Human made.\u201D\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo they \u2013 are they \u2013 do they have any sort of, er, powers?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLight catching,\u201D said the magpie. \u201CThey catch the light. Look!\u201D\r\n\r\nLeif looked, dutifully. They did indeed catch the light rather nicely, but it was becoming evident that there were no divine relics to be found in this place. Rather, Leif had entered the lair of a demon that had been killing humans for centuries for their sparkly things, and he had entered it wearing an incredibly sparkly crown. He straightened it now, nervously, and watched the enormous demon eye track his movement, and remain fixed on the crown after he had put his hands down.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre there any more of those seeds left?\u201D said the giant magpie, conversationally.\r\n\r\n\u201CP-pardon?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe demon turned, and poked their enormous, sharp beak into the entrance of the grotto. The beak was long, but not quite so long that it could reach Leif, pressed as he was at the furthest end of the grotto, with a collection of cracked pince-nez digging into his back.\r\n\r\n\u201CDO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THOSE SEEDS LEFT?\u201D the beak said, very loudly.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! Are \u2013 are you \u2013 the magpie from earlier?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said the magpie from earlier.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd,\u201D Leif hesitated, thrown into sudden doubt. \u201CYou are the demon Rojin, are you?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said the demon Rojin.\r\n\r\nThe beak was very alarming to look at, this close. It was as black and wicked as a flint\u2019s edge. When it opened to speak (which was also alarming) it revealed a sharp looking tongue, as black as onyx.\r\n\r\n\u201CThose seeds,\u201D the beak prompted.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! Yes! I have more,\u201D said Leif. \u201CMany more. An infinite supply. My amulet can make them.\u201D\r\n\r\nRojin removed their beak and pressed their eye to the entrance again to have a good look at the amulet. Leif could see himself reflected in the great oil-dark eye. He looked very anxious. He tried to make himself look less anxious by putting one hand on his hip in a nonchalant manner, but the results were mixed.\r\n\r\n\u201CDid you say infinite?\u201D asked Rojin.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes,\u201D said Leif. \u201CInfinite.\u201D And then, remembering the razer sharp beak, he added hastily \u2013 \u201Cbut only I can operate it. Th-there\u2019s a knack, you know. So, you wouldn\u2019t want to kill me for it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Rojin, rather vaguely. The eye was so large that it was hard to know whether it was staring at the crown, the amulet, or Leif himself.\r\n\r\n\u201CNo,\u201D said Leif, firmly.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me one\u201D, said Rojin. He thrust his beak back through the doorway.\r\n\r\nLeif looked doubtfully at the beak. \u201CWell\u2026 alright. I was just thinking, perhaps, if you did have an item of power around here, perhaps you might consider trading it for some seeds?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe beak opened as much as it could in the low entranceway, which was not very far.\r\n\r\n\u201CAhhh!\u201D the beak said, expectantly.\r\n\r\nLeif unclasped his amulet and rather gingerly placed one of the acorn-sized seeds into the open beak. The beak clacked shut and withdrew. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n\u201CW\u0335\u033D\u0344\u033D\u0320\u0349H\u0337\u034C\u0358\u030E\u035D\u034B\u0322\u0318\u0333\u032A\u032FA\u0336\u035D\u0358\u0305\u0342\u034B\u035D\u0305\u033C\u0347\u0319\u0319T\u0335\u0311\u030C\u0311\u0312\u0357\u035A\u032A\u032E\u0331\u0320\u032C\u031D?\u0337\u0340\u035D\u0348\u0328\u0327\u0339\u0327\u0330?\u201D roared the demon Rojin, in a voice like ragged thunder.\r\n\r\nLeif eyed the open doorway in alarm, through which he could just see a pair of enormous black scaley bird legs, and the white feathered underbelly of Rojin. If he ran now \u2013 if he ran quickly and darted out of the way, perhaps he could escape \u2013 but before he could put this thought into action, Rojin had put their eye to the doorway once more. The eye looked annoyed.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat was TINY. What a tiny little seed. Where are the big ones you gave me earlier?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTh-these are the same ones,\u201D said Leif, faintly. \u201CThere\u2019s only one kind. They\u2019re from the royal tree.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWHAT?\u201D cried Rojin. \u201CWhere are you hiding them? Where? Why? Give me one!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou were much smaller earlier,\u201D offered Leif, timidly.\r\n\r\nThere was another, much longer pause.\r\n\r\n\u201CI know that,\u201D said Rojin, haughtily. \u201CI was much smaller earlier. Yes. I was in my smaller magpie form, wasn\u2019t I? Yes.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe monstrous form at the entranceway seemed to fold itself inwards somehow as if a drawstring were being pulled, and Rojin, in the form of a little magpie, hopped pertly into the grotto. Leif, who had come forward a little bit, shrank sharply back against the wall again.\r\n\r\n\u201CGive me another,\u201D croaked Rojin. \u201CIt wasn\u2019t as good when my beak was big. It tasted very small. I\u2019ll have one in my small beak instead.\u201D They opened their small beak, demonstratively.\r\n\r\nLeif wondered whether he should put a seed into the beak, or whether that might be presumptuous.\r\n\r\n\u201CWait,\u201D said Rojin, and rose, and grew, and in a sudden was in human form, in their cloak of black and white feathers. Their eyes were very bright and very black, just as the magpie\u2019s had been, but were far more expressive, and regarded Leif with much curiosity and interest. Leif, for his part, was quite speechless, having never seen a demon change forms before, and having not expected such a very human looking Rojin to approach him with hand outstretched.\r\n\r\nRojin\u2019s face - their human-seeming face - was a remarkable one. They wore stripes of black and white facepaint, white beneath the eyes; black beneath the mouth. In their face there was a suggestion of immense pride and cruelty, but at the same time something confiding and very full of simplicity. The contrast was what struck Leif at that moment, as opposite as the black and the white feathers. The overall effect was unusually lovely, a very strange beauty \u2013 Leif opened his mouth to speak and could not think of a single word to say.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll try one in this form,\u201D said Rojin. They were standing far too close. \u201CPlease.\u201D\r\n\r\nWordlessly, Leif unclasped the golden locket, took out another seed and dropped it into Rojin\u2019s open palm.\r\n\r\nThe demon tossed it into their mouth at once, and crunched it rapturously. \u201CWow,\u201D they said. \u201CWow. Wow.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGood. Very good. Yes. The raiment, the gifting. So far, very much.\u201D\r\n\r\nNot knowing quite what to say to this, but observing that he did not appear to be under any immediate threat from the demon, Leif said \u2013 \u201Cabout that trade\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere are more seeds?\u201D said Rojin.\r\n\r\n\u201CYes, of course.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CMore seeds for me?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D faltered Leif, \u201CIf\u2026 if\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou are good,\u201D said Rojin, nicely. \u201CYou are very nice.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CTh -thank you,\u201D said Prince Leif.\r\n\r\n\u201CDo you suppose,\u201D said Rojin, \u201Cthat I could have another seed?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CCould I have a divine relic in exchange?\u201D said Leif, bravely.\r\n\r\nRojin parsed this for a moment, then leaned in without any hesitation whatsoever and kissed him. It was a keen, thoughtless, fleeting kiss - all wildflowers - and it was the first time that anyone had ever kissed the crown prince Leif Berranek, although he was almost twenty eight years old.\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D said Leif.\r\n\r\nRojiin looked pleased. They looked at his dogskin gloves, and his patched boots, his glowing armour, his golden locket and his sparkling crown. They looked at his wide, pale eyes and his parted lips and his wheat-coloured hair. \u201CWould you like another?\u201D they asked.\r\n\r\nLeif appeared to be struggling with how best to answer this question.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s alright,\u201D he said at last, with some effort. He gazed at Rojin, quite lost for words. At first, when the demon had come up so close to him, he had become as pale as death; but now the blood had rushed back to his cheeks. \u201CThe thing is\u2026 I was actually \u2013 I was looking for items of power, you see\u2026 there may have been a misunderstanding.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CItems of power?\u201D Rojin cocked his head to one side. \u201CAfbrig\u00F0i?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CPardon?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019re talking about the calamities, aren\u2019t you? Abrig\u00F0i. Calamities. The singing swords and the burning cloaks? The little bits of talking jewellery?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYes!\u201D said Leif, excitedly. \u201CThat\u2019s them! Only, we call them Divine Relics!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat!\u201D Rojin rather unexpectedly burst out laughing. \u201CYou call them the same word as a kiss! How funny you humans are! Ha! Ha! Ha! A kiss, I like that!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201COh,\u201D said Leif, blushing again. \u201CWell. We don\u2019t exactly \u2013\u201C\r\n\r\n\u201CI understand,\u201D said Rojin, serenely. \u201CYou like the calamities. You\u2019d like some for the nest?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe nest?\u201D\r\n\r\nRojin gestured around them at the grotto. Seeing Leif\u2019s dumbfounded expression, they added hastily - \u201CIt\u2019s not finished. It could go much higher than this. This is just for starters. Lots of room for Abrig\u00F0i.\u201D\r\n\r\nLeif gazed around, distractedly. He looked rather flustered \u2013 his blush had not disappeared yet, and he spoke quickly and self consciously. \u201CSo there are none here? Well, that\u2019s alright. I\u2019m on a mission, is all. It isn\u2019t going very well so far. I\u2019m supposed to collect them up, as many as I can -they\u2019re dangerous, you see. I\u2019m not surprised you call them calamities in your tongue. Ha! Yes. I\u2019m to send them back to the castle to be destroyed. It doesn\u2019t matter that there aren\u2019t any here though, after all. Hey ho! It was only a rumour. I thought that Dread Grasp might be here.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever heard of it,\u201D said Rojin.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve never heard of Dread Grasp? The gloves of protection?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNever.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat, you must have! Dread Grasp! From the song!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CNot at all! What song?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CGrasping the heart of forgetting,\r\n\r\nHolding firm the threads of dream,\r\n\r\nGath\u2019ring the stems of oblivion\r\n\r\nStitching closed the broken seam\u201D\r\n\r\nLeif paused, embarrassed. His voice, as clear as birdsong, rang out against the eyeglasses and the mirrors and the broken bottles.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s about a pair of gloves,\u201D he said shyly, rather aware that Rojin was staring.\r\n\r\n\u201CThat is a human song, I think. Could I have another seed?\u201D\r\n\r\nLeif gave them one. The demon ate it very slowly and consideringly, looking at Leif all the while with their bright dark eyes. When they had finished it, they said,\r\n\r\n\u201CI accept.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou do?\u201D said Leif. Then, \u201Caccept what?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThe gift was good. Very good. I like the gifts very much. I like very much that there is an infinite supply of gifts,\u201D said Rojin. \u201CI liked the song very much also. Yes. The crown is precisely to my liking. I like you very much, prince.\u201D\r\n\r\nLeif looked at the demon gravely for a moment, as if he were unsure whether he were being teased or not. But seeing that Rojin\u2019s expression was quite as serious as his own, he suddenly broke out smiling.\r\n\r\n\u201COh! I think I like you too, Rojin \u2013 you are not at all what I thought you would be. I am a great believer in destiny \u2013 I don\u2019t know if demons believe in a thing like that, but \u2013 that is - it seems as if we were supposed to meet. I had a strange feeling when I first saw you. I almost felt as though I knew you; as if I had seen you before, in a dream perhaps.\u201D He stopped, confused. Rojin looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd you could help me collect Divine Relics? That\u2019s the very thing I\u2019ve set out to do!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CThere are no Abrig\u00F0i here,\u201D the demon said. \u201CBut if those are what you like, I shall help you get some. Yes! In return for your song and your gifts and your raiment. And then you\u2019ll see how powerful Rojin is! A strong bird! A builder of tall nests!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIs that so?\u201D murmured the Prince, a little nonsensically.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have to decide now, of course,\u201D Rojin said hastily. \u201CThree moons is traditional. You can wait. You can see.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CI see,\u201D said the Prince. \u201CAnd - after three moons?\u201D\r\n\r\nRojin placed Leif\u2019s hand into their own and laced their fingers together, six against five.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe can marry!\u201D }\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law. Pinky\r\nMay '22\r\nNice!\r\n\r\nGreat writing mate, looking forward to more.\r\n\r\nThe only minor point I would make is to contextualize that although the Mirror Grotto is a little observed Wonder, it is so in comparison to other Wonders if that makes sense?\r\n\r\nAs there are only 50 Wonders spread out and over 1M+ player entry points from when the Lore starts for Realms, I would maybe emphasize the deaths or danger a little more. Tiny point, it is pretty clear the point you have made with the quote, but just because of how rare Wonders are thought id mention it in case you wanted to expand upon how Leif managed his feat, and how rare it is.\r\n\r\nWe got Undead Faction, Demonic Faction, and more being built out.\r\nLovely :slight_smile:\r\n\r\nAll the best mate.",

What did I miss?\r\n\r\nThe familiar feeling of bitter vitriol washes over me.\r\n\r\nNo. I haven\u2019t failed entirely. Not yet. I may not have seen them coming, but the fools only took down the Facade. They didn\u2019t find anything important. They didn\u2019t take anything True.\r\n\r\nI dig my fingers into the rubble, into the ground and tune my heart and my mind to its strength and my true home within.\r\n\r\nDarkness.\r\n\r\nRelief.\r\n\r\nThe floor dissolves momentarily into ether to let me in.\r\n\r\nHome.\r\n\r\nThis place knows magic unlike any that we practise. How can it restore me so, as soon as I enter? How can it drive the world outside so far away, making everything else so unimportant? The dungeon. My home. My sanctum. All that\u2019s interesting to me in the universe is now held between these walls. Comfort and adventure all at once.\r\n\r\nLike you, Death.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the wand strikes a comfortable balance with the soothing smells of Death.\r\n\r\nPeaceful, calming, welcoming but also brimming with mystery and potential. Not everyone sees you that way, do they? I feel bad for those who are scared of you. For those who don\u2019t know or understand you as intimately as I do. Well, fuck them! I\u2019m grateful for your company. For all the things we create together.\r\n\r\nFor Amaranthine.\r\n\r\nThe coldness of the Grave Wand seeps through me into Amaranthine, lifting her from her resting place and drawing her to the workbench.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t need to make her for them anymore, do I? You took them all. Maybe I\u2019ve been thinking about this all wrong. Maybe they did me a huge favour. How did I not see this before? The Tower is a small price to pay for this freedom. I can make her how I want now. I can take as long as I want making her. We can make her beautiful, Death. We can make her unique. We can make her interesting.\r\n\r\nHer body contorts into strange shapes that I had never seen before. Strange, but also somehow familiar?\r\n\r\nA lost, forgotten feeling finds me.\r\n\r\nI can do anything I want. They don\u2019t matter anymore. Nothing matters anymore. There are no rules anymore.\r\n\r\nA violent surge of energy passes through me into her. She disintegrates into a thousand pieces and grafts herself back together onto a pair of demon wings.\r\n\r\nAre you excited, Amaranthine? How shall I make you? I didn\u2019t think of this when I named you, but did you know, in another world, amaranth is a shade of violet? Did you know they called me Violette? Violette. The woman I never wanted to be. The woman I don\u2019t have to be anymore. But if I\u2019m not her, then who am I? Could I have been you? Maybe. But who are you, Amaranthine? A child that has ceased to exist. The child I could have been if not for them?\r\n\r\nI recognise the shapes her body is making.\r\n\r\nI dreamed them up in that graveyard, the longest time ago. When I first found you, Death. Do you remember? When I ran away from them. When I was hiding from them. Why did I go back?\r\n\r\nIf it was just peace, just happiness, just goodness that you took from me\u2026\u2026 You took more. I\u2019ll never know what I could have become.\r\n\r\nAmaranthine. A mystery.\r\n\r\nAre you a monster too? You\u2019d think I wouldn\u2019t have become one if not for them, wouldn\u2019t you? But no. I think I was always going to become some version of this. This. The \u201COther\u201D.\r\n\r\nA darkness enters her and spreads through her being.\r\n\r\nI should make more of you, shouldn\u2019t I, Amaranthine? From more children that have ceased to exist. For every trick, every game they played, the child that could have existed had they not. For every -\r\n\r\nHer eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not possible. I\u2019m imagining things, aren\u2019t I?\r\n\r\nBut something flows from me through the Wand into her, forming dark red questions in her eyes and forever lost to me. That was a mistake. I\u2019m losing focus. I break my bond with the Wand.\r\n\r\n~o~\r\n\r\nI try to grasp at that memory like a madwoman every time, desperately trying to hold on to what I saw in her eyes. But it slips through my mind into the far ends of my consciousness, every time, lost to me as it was to her. But I remember how it felt. That bone-chilling sense of dread. Hysterical sense of power. I cannot ignore it like she did. There is danger there. I am sure of it.\r\n}",

A journal of an investigator found decades ago in Kaddun. He writes about encountering one of her chimeras. He said it made calculated moves. That it moved with purpose. With intention.\r\n\r\nBut surely, that\u2019s not possible? A witch, even one with demon blood, no matter how powerful, cannot create a being like that? One that has its own mind? Has thoughts???

Everyone I bring home with me is so busy fearing you, they have no time for me. I wish, for once, one of them would actually talk to me. Say something worth hearing, for once. If they had anything worth preserving in them, I wouldn\u2019t so easily give them to you. But they\u2019re all the same. I wonder if there\u2019s a way to keep a part of them in the piece, just an echo of what made them them.

Is there any part of you worth keeping in Amaranthine?\r\n\r\nMy awareness reaches out through the Wand, searching the echo of her consciousness.\r\n\r\nFear. Horror. Panic.\r\n\r\nThey told you to fear us, didn\u2019t they? I know known terrors seem safer than havens unknown. The monsters we call family seem safer than those they call \u201Cthe Other\u201D.

The girl whose name and life I stole. The girl that would have been Violette if not for their games. She never really left me, but without the Wand, I wouldn\u2019t have known. She\u2019s good at hiding at the far edges of my consciousness. I think she felt bad for me. I\u2019ll never be sure if it\u2019s pity or vitriol that kept her from moving on.

Why is this one different?\r\n\r\nIn all her other visions, her connection with Violette was very weak. But that flash of pain when she was thinking about Violette\u2019s body. It almost seemed like Violette was actually responding? Did she want the witch demon to find her body?\r\n\r\nShe had all the items. She still has the ring in this vision",

Shillings for a killing!” The man cried, hocking his wares of putrid potions all with one goal. In the Dark Markets, anything goes but quality comes at a cost. A robed figure approached with a purse that clinked softly with every stride. The Bastard, as he was known, lowered his voice to capture the attention of his hooded audience. It was a keen trick he had learned over the years, making an individual out as if they had his full attention. “Only the best, nearly untraceable,” he waved his hand over a small vial with a sludge the colour of putrid milk. “None for me today,” the would-be customer replied, he had come with a purpose, “I’m only here for Furakh.” This stopped the Bastard cold. Looking this way and that before he motioned the patron beyond his stand. “That’s it for today folks! Come back tomorrow to kill your loved ones for fortune or your enemies for revenge!” The Bastard pulled a rope and the heavy velvet curtains fell shrouding them in total darkness. The robed person removed their purse and undid the tie, slowly loosening the cinch, and light started to spill forth. “Not here!” the Bastard hissed, “we must move to a more secure area.” With a great heave, he pulled the heavy chains that were covered by a box and a hatch swung open. The two descended and the tent was left in complete darkness once more. At the bottom of a spiral staircase that felt like it would never end the Bastard pressed his hand against the stones as a passageway fell into view. Torches along the wall flickered to life except for one which sputtered but never managed to catch. “Damn magician, I had these sconces installed a year ago and he’s been by twice a month to fix at least one of them. Charges me through the roof for it. Bloody extortion.” His guest said nothing. “Just through here,” and it was, for when they entered the room the visitor had never seen a dungeon so lavish. There were pelts and velvets and wines from the genesis age… And in the centre of the room, the piece for all resistance, the golden skull of Once-King Furakh. “How did you come to posses-” “Bah bah bah, show me what you’ve brought before answers are wrought,” the Bastard rubbed his hands deviously. “Geez, you sound like a Mage, talking in rhymes that way,” but the robed man began once more to undo his purse. The Bastard shrugged, “I’ve got a Mage cousin I spoke to just the other day, must have stuck in my mind.” The robed figure held out the purse, this time for the Bastard to open, the light already leaking through the cinch. With delicate hands and a ginger touch, the Bastard took the weight of the silk bag, the clinking sounding closer to chatter when held this close. He poked his finger in the top, “YOUCH!” and pulled his finger to his mouth to nurse the wound. They had drawn blood. “They’re truly alive!” the Bastard cried and poured some of the contents onto his palm flooding the room in light. Golden Ants glimmered in his hand. The tradesman flicked his hand and Ants began marching, encircling the Bastard’s wrist. With a word spoken but forgotten they clinched one to another and bonded into chains. Heavier chains than the Bastard had ever held. They dragged his weight to the floor and the Ants kept marching, binding him. “What is the meaning of this!” the Bastard cried his voice growing sore after a long day of yelling as a vendor, it adopted a shrill tinge of fear. “It’s simple, I am the Once-King Furakh, and I’m here for my skull,” the robed man walked past the Bastard and lowered his hood, revealing a bald head tattooed with two coins under either eye. “It is actually the skull of my dear brother, who took the fall when they raided our castle. I was mistaken as a mere advisory to the king. I was jailed for it but I kept my wits about me, and my head.” With emphasis, the visitor plucked the skull from the pedestal. With another unspoken word, the skull began to chip disassembling once more as a troop of Golden Ants pealing themselves from the familiar macabre shape. These marched down Furakh’s robes toward the Bastard and his chain began to spread thin, covering his body as almost like a liquid. The troop of Ants parading from Furakh joined with the greater golden colony enveloping the Bastard. “You’ll never get out of the dungeon without me! Only I know the guragghg” the Ants had found their way into the Bastard’s mouth and stiffened his tongue. “Oh, that’s alright, because in just a few moments, you will be just another thousand troops in the ever-growing army of the Once-King Furakh,” and with that, the Bastard was entirely consumed, entombed in gold. Slowly he crumbled away. And with more Ants than Furakh had entered with, he left. The doors swung open, the torches lighting just as they should, save for that wonky one. “And I’m taking this back as well,” Furakh said to the colony, as he yanked the Banner of green and black featuring chains, coins, and the golden skull of his brother…",
    "Realms Slice of Life: Dadič Writing Nov 2022 Nov 2022 Pinky Nov '22 Just a bit of stuff I wrote whilst in the hospital to practice taking the geography of a Realm into account when writing and to distract myself. Posting it before I forget all about it. Realm was chosen at random. # Dadič 1 Atlas Render 4269 1600×660 97.5 KB “LAUNCH!” Boulders that took several men to load were swiftly whipped into the air, the larger ones doused with tar pitch and tree resin in advance for this moment. Marsigt’s coarse voice commanded the mangonels at his disposal to pepper the direction of the incoming fleet’s ships with the malicious payload. His vocal cords had been worn down over decades of shouting amidst the din of war, gravelly as the stones hurtling through the night sky. A hit at the current range was unlikely, but neither was that the purpose of his ranging shots. The sea surrounding the harbor was known for its shallow reefs and made swift changes in navigation a risky proposition for a deep-keeled ship. Islands dotted the bay and a combination of low water and the ever-shifting, unpredictable tides of a planet with two moons made an accurate topographical seafloor map a necessity for any sailor that wished to avoid a lungful of water. The duress of rock by the tonnage, hurtling from above against an unskilled force could cause any slight misstep to render those maps useless; until a Captain or Second mate could re-confirm their actual position. The village towns surrounding the ports knew to keep shutters closed and reduce light to minimize accurate rangefinding during a raid. All and any advantage was to be pressed into service of war. Shipwrecks littered the sea floor around the bay, adding to the chaos of attacking the ports of Dadič. A giant ship’s rotting mast could still easily puncture a lower-class vessel. The corpse-fertilized sea garden stretched over a steep drop from shallow water to ocean deep, attracting marine predators of all sizes to feast on the remnants of a failed attack, or heavens forbid, the soon-to-be slaughtered villagers upon success. Each minute spent holding the fleet from disembarking their armies bought the defenders a greater chance of at least minimizing the damage the latest raid could do. For these ships were only scouts, the lights further out to sea told of a more significant number awaiting dawn to sail coastward. Although many soldiers might grumble at heaving the boulders up the mountain, the altitude further boosted the deadly payload of the artillery division and gave them a distinct range advantage. As his mentor taught him, anything and everything was a weapon, if utilized correctly. Captain Marsigt Marsigt.Stonewalll 1920×1920 189 KB Gravity was no exception - Marsigt made a point of specialized training for any who wished to improve its proper application with the assorted defensive ballistae and mangonels. His skill in raising new regiments up to battle hardened soldiers was why he had been sent here after all. The last raid had lost them three villages harvest and a good number of decent men and women some of whom might be the unfortunate lot on the same ships he was now systematically pushing towards doom, be it by the oceans depths or their commanders sword for cowardice. As a Knight-Captain of the Order of Brilliance, it was unbecoming to have those under his command waste ammunition on shots of no purpose. He would keep the barrage to a minimum until the probability of a hit became a near certainty, Knowledge was a currency unto its own in the Realms. This attitude exemplified the Order’s comparatively specialized and formally educated soldiers. The invader’s scouts were sent forth to reduce Marsigt’s ammunition, and he held no doubt that the bulk of the force further out to sea would calculate any sunk vessels’ location to improve their own chances of navigating the treacherous waters. “LOOSE” His following command was directed towards the division of archers, not to fire pointlessly at the incoming ships, but to alight the most immense boulders sailing through the air and let fire wreak havoc amongst the smaller ships’ timber planking. Trained from when they could draw back a modified short bow, the archers under his command could often ricochet their flaming arrows to hit up to three of the boulders in a single shot. How they managed such a feat was a bet he had painfully learned; losing enough coin at the start of his watch to never doubt their skills again. Poor bastards, Marsigt mused as the pitch tar caught alight forming streaking stars in the moonlight, Titans. Again. An assortment of their conscript crews and officers found to have erred too often by the looks. Years of naval duty in his youth had enabled him to assess the quality of a Captain by the state of their sails. No Admiral worth his salt would commit a Hartwood ship to a probing attack, let alone the dreaded Ironwoods. One good hit would assist his artillery division to better calculate their next shots. They were not overly short on ammunition, but his men’s strength was not endless, nor did they have a mage to assist their efforts. Raising his eye to the scope, he saw that he had again put too little faith in his mangonel division, for they had struck one galleon and three corvettes. Assuming that reinforcements arrived in time, he would be delighted to buy those men a few brandy casks for that small victory. A galleon’s sails had alighted and the flames allowed him to spot rowboats steadily weaving their way further toward shore. Before his night vision was ruined, he swiftly withdrew his eye and stowed his telescope. Although it was not enchanted, the Ethereal Silica optics made it a prized heirloom passed down to him from father to son. Records kept by his House, the esteemed Owl, Catapult, and Crown proved its provenance before even the Great Cataclysm. His extended family had commanded artillery divisions from the Arctic Mirror to the Dread Sea over the eons. As brothers and sisters in arms, and unfortunately, often as much against them. His conscience could rest easy tonight, for his was not a seafaring House. He held little malice for the rowboats, but knowing they were coming forth was enough to start his secondary preparations. The forty pairs of soldiers manning the ballistae were eager to add to the mayhem, and with a stream of targets coming their way, the cranking of handles clinked as the mighty strings were wrenched back. War raged eternal in the Realms, and a blood bond did not outrank a Lord’s command. Not if one wished to survive a successful battle; although it counted enough to sometimes stay the victors’ sword in the aftermath. Rare was a House that refused to inflict violence on its own, but among some of the more ancient Houses, it was known to have happened over the annals of recorded history. He held no strong hate towards the Order of Titans, indeed his sister was betrothed to a lower Lord of their Order, but this was the third raid in as many weeks. Whether they were desperate to secure a beachhead for a further assault, or simply had a poor harvest and were hoping to pillage a few granaries, it mattered not. His Lord’s command was clear, no military vessel was to make landfall. Many a Lord’s logistics relied upon the harbors of Dadič to supply their relatively meager Realms. To that end, he stepped down from the high walls and began preparations to repel any other surprises that the fleet may have in store.",

Or perhaps it was beneath the ocean, or underground. It could have waged across the three, either in turn or all at once. What is certain is that it ended.\n\nAnd even then, some Orders would say that the war continues. For though its warriors have retreated, they carelessly littered their materiel across the world. Fragments of their fearsome weapons, impossible vehicles, fabulous workshops and improbable texts are everywhere, with as many names to them as there are to birds.\n\nThough scattered and diminished, these remnants still retain great potential. A mechanism from an unknowable engine may fit around a finger, a cartridge of demonic ammunition could be fashioned into the heel of a boot. A boiler stove for a god might make a handsome set of armour for a person. And so, as people learned how to repurpose these scraps and leftovers to their advantage, they played a part in the history of almost every people of the world. Nations rose because they possessed them, and empires fell when they lost them.\n\nOne became a decoration for a baby’s crib. It was a ring of thin wire, dangling above that crib on a piece of fishing line. Light that passed through the ring was split into rainbows that danced on the walls. The crib was in a nursery, and the nursery was in a cottage of the town of Schtasspez, which flew the banner of the House of the mammoth that coiled a great tree. The town was in the Realm of Spezlaas, in the half-frozen cap of the world. Nobody recorded its discovery or speculated as to its original purpose. It had found long and good use on that piece of wire, amusing babies.\n\nOne of the last babies to use it for that purpose became a fearsome mage, who would use the ring, among other things, to force a great many changes on the world. She did not have a name when she was in the crib, for the time in which she lay there was before the traditional naming ceremony of her House. But when she had it, her name would be Spezlaasin Thint Sayadaw. ‘Spezlaasin’ was a name common to almost everyone in her home realm, ‘Thint’ was her House name and ‘Sayadaw’ was the name she was to give to outsiders. But she decided at an early age that she would refuse to give her House name to anyone and would not respond to it, an early sign of the wilfulness that would become known to all when she brought the stars to Earth. This game she played about her name became reality and so Sayadaw, a declaration of otherness, became her entire name.\n\nBut as a baby Sayadaw only cooed and gargled at the chaotic fluttering patterns of light slowly rotating around her nursery. If the two sisters that followed had not been visited by cot death in that very same crib, the ring would have remained there on its wire to distract all its successive occupants, as it had for all the decades in which her family had made a home there.\n\nBut after her second sister had fallen asleep and not awoken, Sayadaw’s mother had packed up the nursery in a rare burst of activity that came between her long fallow periods. The crib was turned into firewood and replaced with a loom that would seldom be used. The little ring had been taken off its wire and put in a drawer, where it was found by the young and lonely Sayadaw. She developed a habit of lying on her back for hours on the floor, one eye screwed tightly shut, peering through the ring as she held it aloft to a sunbeam in her stubby fingers.\n\nShe learned to experiment. When the sun went down she held the small annulus up to the light of candles, the moon and the stars. She realised that the colour of almost everything was altered when seen through it. Some stars changed colour in different ways to others. She knew that dead things shone differently to living things, that salt water was different to fresh water, and that hen eggs were different to duck eggs. As these were differences that everyone knew, the people of her House treated her with patience and good humour. This child who kept snails in a box, who hoarded jars of water and scraps of metal, who fancied herself a fortune-teller but told fortunes that were patently false and absurd, became an unofficial House mascot. She was welcome to come and go as she pleased into every home and workshop, to visit the chicken coops so long as she treated the hens well; to rifle through the bins and the cesspits so long as she washed afterwards. She endeared herself to the furnacemen at the Smiths when she declared that she knew they had changed the source of the fuel. She knew because the fire blazed a different colour through her ring. They made a deal with the girl: that if she agreed to be quiet and not yell fortunes at them, that they would make her a small tube for the ring which she could fasten to her head with a strap and wear like a long, protruding eyepatch. Sayadaw strutted around with the ridiculous brass tube on her face with the greatest pride, demanding that people admire it.\n\nOnce, when her father suffered a fit, as he did from time to time, Sayadaw stood in the doorway and watched him through her tube while her mother held him down. The patterns of light running through his neck and head were like an entirely new form of music. She was growing, and what had been a delightful eccentricity was becoming worrisome to her family. Shortly after witnessing the fit, she wandered into the kitchen of a neighbouring farmhouse and solemnly told the farmwife that the crops in her field would not grow that year. She said she had been looking at the soil and the colours of it were wrong, and quite unlike the colours of all the other fields she had seen this season. This was the first fortune Sayadaw told that became true, because she had learned that the patterns of colour that swam over fertile soil was distinct to that of waterlogged, barren or dry soil.\n\nDiscussions were had on Sayadaw’s behalf. Her mother was unapproachable or quarrelsome with most people in their House, and did not speak to anyone at all in the neighbouring Houses. Her father was too sick most of the time and spent half of each year or more in the refuge in Spozschpezh. But the nuns from the Scrollhouse in Kezkiisch had heard of this bright child and took it upon themselves to enrol Sayadaw. The Scrollhouse was aligned to the Dark Order of Vitriol, as was all organised society in Spezlaas. The Order of Vitriol had begun as a group of people obsessed with the acquisition and study of the remnants from the War in Heaven. By the time Sayadaw was ordained into Vitriol, it functioned as a de facto municipal government for much of the Northern Continent. The nuns came again and again to their home and told Sayadaw’s mother that the Mother Superior herself had asked for Sayadaw’s attendance, that she recognised that the girl had been studying a rare and useful relic since she was born. After some frustrating and confused resistance, Sayadaw’s mother relented and finally the nuns from the Scrollhouse came to remove Sayadaw and leave her mother to stare at a dusty loom.\n\nSayadaw had met nuns and monks and scribes and masters from the Order on several fleeting occasions during her explorations of the village, but had not been cognisant of there being other Orders in the world, even though she had enjoyed the travelling clown acts from the Order of The Twins and been thrilled by the endless stories of daring Sheriffs sent by the Order of Fury to fight injustice. People from the Order were simply adults, who were not her parents, that had useless jobs. Her mother made a half-hearted attempt to explain to her that she would be taught by the nuns of Vitriol how to read and write and to study the remnants they held, which sounded all well and good, but then the transport came to take her away to Kezkiisch and for the rest of her life she would only spend a handful of nights in her own bed, in her own home.\n\nTears were expected for new arrivals at the school and the nuns were experts in turning them to steam by way of scolding. But Sayadaw’s tears were of a flavour that took the nuns by surprise. There was an outrage to them that set the girl apart right away. Though Kezkiisch was one day’s easy journey away from Sayadaw’s home in Schtasspez, to the young girl it might as well have been as remote and alien as a city on the Moon. When she cried on her first day at the Scrollhouse, it was because she was so angry that no one had thought to bring her here before, to see all the people and machines and wires and horses and coal-fires. Her tears were appreciated and quelled by Spezlaasin Wioleta Ozige, a young research assistant of the Mother Superior, who took the furious little girl under her wing from that first day until Ozige’s last.\n\nSeveral of the girls at the school had arrived there with an attachment to a powerful item already formed. Sayadaw was able to negotiate with the nuns for the right to wear her eyepiece during classes twice a week. She was silently admitted to the elite clique of girls that had such trinkets, but rarely invoked this honour. She didn’t think much of the hand-me-down wands and magical hats the other girls had. She was only interested in the new insights she could uncover with the help of Ozige and the Scrollhouse’s resources.\n\nThe nuns were more concerned with her more mundane studies - scribing and languages and the ways of the Order. She had to learn the ciphers that adherents of the Order used to communicate with each other, and the way to update them after the appropriate feast days passed on the calendar. She was taught of the Order’s severe philosophy of improvement. Every adherent of the Order was heated in the crucible of precise scorn. She learned to accept the criticisms of others and how to hone the blade of her words. This idea extended beyond the sphere of the self to encompass the world, for nothing was infinite or divine to the Order of Vitriol. Everything on Earth or in the Heavens could be reduced if one had the right kind of crucible.\n\nSayadaw knew all this already, for where others saw plain light or dull dirt, she saw patterns and had learned their meanings. It was natural to her to believe that nothing was as it first seemed, and that the process of discovery was necessary, sometimes ecstatic and always disquieting. She became interested in the geological specimens held in the large Library just opposite the Scrollhouse. With Ozige’s help she fashioned a hinged box of ivory, small enough to fit in her fist. The box could hold a chunk of quartz crystal and, when shaken, would ripple out colours visible only through her eyepiece. She got into the unsettling habit of shaking this ivory rattle at mundane objects, which maddened her teachers and alienated her from the few girls brave enough to be her friends. But when she brought a tea tray into her class and said that she could use her rattle to identify a cup of poison among six cups of mint tea, a change occurred. Her teacher decided that a poisoning was as good as a beating to an impossible child and had Sayadaw and a volunteer blindfolded while the cups were shuffled, and placed Sayadaw in the crucible of her own experiment. She was allowed to use the rattle and the eyepiece to assess the cups. She said that the poisoned cup shone differently in the presence of the rattle, on account of the tiny pieces of metal in the water, and drank six cups in as many gulps. Sayadaw was certainly being honed - now she could tell her own fortune. She was rewarded by being sent to spend the rest of the day in Ozige’s cell. There she giggled to herself until Ozige returned from work and fed her honey and carob gum in an unregulated burst of pride.\n\nOne of Sayadaw’s favourite hobbies was to crack an egg over a patch of bare soil. She could see the immediate response through her eyepiece - a rippling of faint, razor-thin lightning bolts crackling out from the eggy epicentre to beyond the edge of her vision. It delighted her to know that the spilling of an egg, which was a trivial thing to everyone she had ever met, was an event of grave importance to the world of the soil. Sayadaw’s trick with the cups of tea in class was its own kind of spilled egg. Another kind of lens behind another kind of eye, watching from high above, would see the news of Sayadaw’s feat spread across the gossip grapevines of the Houses, amplified by the intelligence networks of the Orders, to reach distant shores.\n\nMuch of her early schooling was intended to arm her with knowledge of the other Orders, so when she met someone who belonged to the Order of Power she was much better prepared than she had been when she first met someone from the Order of Vitriol. In a way, everyone was better prepared for an encounter with the Order of Power because, unlike the Order of Vitriol, the Order of Power operated brazenly, out in the open. Theirs was not the way of ciphers and secrets, of cloistered chapters whispering in attics, but of a marching band with an exhaustive repertoire. An old joke - how do you tell if someone is ordained into the Order of Power? Easy, it will be the first, second and third thing they will tell you. To walk among the Realm of Vitriol was to meet ordinary people who did extraordinary things behind closed doors. In the Realm of Order, the division of labour was clear, and its adherents wore its symbol plainly on their chests.\n\n–\n\nSayadaw was approached by a Wanderer from the Order of Power shortly after her graduation. She was by then a young woman, taller than most of her classmates, with few friends and no need for more. Most of all she wanted to put the world in a crucible so she could see what it was made of. The Wanderer suggested that the Order of Power could help her with that.\n\nThe magnificent shambling man knocked politely on the door of her old home. She had returned there, to the gentle shade of the Banner of Mammoth Snake Tree, to attend to the matters surrounding her mother’s funeral. Her father had not left the refuge and his own funeral would come soon. She had swapped her old bed with the dusty loom so that she could lie in a sun beam like she had when she was small – as she was when the knock came.\n\nThe Wanderer from the Order of Power was very tall, with skin much darker than Sayadaw’s own. He had large, saucer-like eyes beaming from underneath the hood of his cloak. The cloak itself was another remnant from a lost time, a lush mane of broad-bladed grass that hung down the considerable distance to the Wanderer’s ankles. Two woven reeds hung across his shoulders, the ends of which were unseen for they sat in his mouth. Consequently, he was unable to speak, so handed Sayadaw a written message instead.\n\nIt was a flax envelope bearing the seal of the Order of Power. So it had been the first thing he had said. She broke the seal and read the message on vellum. It had no cipher and was written in the most commonly used language of the North. It was a summons to continue her education in the South East, on the distant fjords circling the Tides of Tears. She thanked the Wanderer and asked him for time to consider the decision. He produced a small scrap of paper, much rougher than the one that had been in the envelope, and scratched a response with a stick of burned willow.\n\n“You may take all the time you do require. With your permission, I will remain here outside of your dwelling until such time you need me,” it read.\n\nShe went to see Ozige, leaving the man standing on the grass with his back to the sun, slurping on his tubes. She presented the note to her teacher and surrogate mother.\n\n“You can refuse,” said Ozige. “We do need you here. The Library has centuries of research you could shed new light on. You would be made a Curator before the end of the year.”\n\n“Everything that is here came from out there,” said Sayadaw, folding the message back into its envelope. “I could fill the Library from floor to ceiling with monographs of miracles but they would be written down in code. The knowing of them would not leak out beyond the walls.” Ozige knew then that Sayadaw could not be contained, and that the things she could see were things of the Light, not of the Dark. If she worked for the Library or the Archive she could discover such wonderful things, but they would be secret, hoarded. Ozige conceded the point and, though she was trained to never allow her heart to break, she did feel a small crack within her chest.\n\nSayadaw left with the Wanderer the following day. The journey to the Realms of Power would be an education in itself. Ozige was the only one to witness the leaving of Spezlaas’ most talented student, to see someone take that unusual step across the chasm of the Original Schism, that scar that marked the division between the Light Orders and the Dark. If Sayadaw returned, she would return changed, and only the keenest eye would be able to tell the difference.",

    "Realms - The Autonomous World 3/1/2023 by 🍞 Bibliotheca DAO has been building an eternal and ever-expanding onchain game world called the Realms. Realms - The Autonomous World Bibliotheca DAO has been building an eternal and ever-expanding onchain game world called the Realms. Examining the notion of Realms as an ‘Autonomous World’, we'll also reflect on Loot as the catalyst - the 'big bang' event that led us here. Loot may not be considered an onchain game in the traditional sense, but it has undoubtedly transformed the gaming landscape by introducing the concept of an open and composable world. Loot was the ‘big bang’ that created a new digital universe. Interlinked worlds are being built in that universe, like Realms, Banners and Hyperloot. Other worlds are being built in parallel universes, those that forked Loot, like DOPE DAO and Treasure DAO. As demonstrated by the amount of building, Loot was a moment of inspiration for a new generation of developers, who are eager to collaborate across the digital realm on a shared mission to build and expand the shared ‘Lootverse’. Loot transcends conventional notions, representing more of an abstract, creative idea that permeates culture. For just over 18 months, our contributors have been diligently developing, refining, and crafting an open-source vision for a CC0 permissionless world. Our concept has evolved from its initial focus on land ownership within the Lootverse to an autonomous, onchain world that operates independently. In retrospect, our ambitious design objectives for the DAO’s first game title, ‘Realms: Eternum’, were ahead of their time in 2021, rendering them unattainable at that juncture. Undeterred, we continue to forge ahead and build upon our progress. Tackling the hardest blockchain problems encouraged us to find and collaborate with the most talented problem solvers. We are proud to be at the heart of an uber talented, forward thinking blockchain development community.ghgerterttetyutyu4345 A game set in The Realms Autonomous World Realms was born out of the Loot phenomenon, carrying a distinct vision for a continually evolving, modular game that could flawlessly incorporate all Loot assets. The concept of \"Autonomous Worlds\" hadn't been coined at that time; instead, we initially referred to the idea for ‘Realms: Eternum’ (aka Eternum) as a Massively Multiplayer Online Onchain Composable Game (MMOCCG, yes LOL). Later on, we dubbed it the ‘Eternal Game’. However, none of these terms resonated as powerfully or evoked the same emotional response as \"Autonomous Worlds\" to describe the broader hyperstructure in which the game Eternum sits. We don't take the AW concept lightly; not every game is an Autonomous World (AW) – there is a spectrum. The chads at Lattice originally conceived the AW terminology, and we are embracing this shared meme as it provides a vivid depiction of what we have been building for a year and a half. From this point forward, we will retire our internal names (Eternal Games, MMOCCG) and refer to the project as, the Realms Autonomous World. ‘Realms: Eternum’ will be the first title launched in that world. Autonomous worlds bear a remarkable resemblance to blockchains in their nature. Once deployed, they endure, with their state persisting for the duration of the chain. Players can join or leave, and developers can build upon these worlds by deploying features in a permissionless way, akin to how contracts are deployed onto a chain. There is no universally accepted definition for an Autonomous World; however, our criteria for labeling a game as such requires at least these two essential features: Decentralized data availability layer: While the state execution may reside on a centralized layer, it is crucial that the state can be reconstructed if the execution layer ceases to exist. Rollups offer a solution, providing increased capacity execution layers while ensuring data is permanently settled on Ethereum. This guarantees the world's perpetual persistence. Permissionless entry point for expanding the world: The World contract must be capable of accepting new systems and components without requiring permission. While this doesn't imply that every component and system will be utilized, they must adhere to this pattern, ensuring open and unrestricted access for potential enhancements. Note: All Autonomous Worlds are onchain games. Not all onchain games are Autonomous Worlds. In our view, an onchain game becomes an AW when it can be expanded permissionlessly. This is just our interpretation and the heuristics we are following, but it is by no means cannonical. The open nature of an AW fosters the development of intriguing economic models, such as the \"Play to Die\" concept, which allows developers to compete at the application layer within the world akin to an app store. Autonomous worlds ought to be credibly neutral and not subject to central control by any group or individual. Be cautious of those who exploit the AW name for a quick profit in the future. Eternum's launch is not the end game for Realms or Loot; rather, it marks the beginning of a continuous evolution. It is our hope that in 10 years, Eternum will bear little resemblance to the game as it exists today, having grown and transformed over time. Where we started Our initial game design, conceived in 2021, was based on the diamond pattern and ran on Arbitrum. As we navigated the development process, we encountered various challenges and came to reason that the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity were not as suitable as we would have liked for our World. As we investigated various options, Starknet emerged as the leading long-term solution due to its ability to abstract from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) while maintaining compatibility. Enthusiastically, we adopted Cairo and restructured the game using a Module Controller system, originally conceptualized by Perama for Dopewars. Implementing this modular controller pattern enabled the successful separation of security modules and state from the core logic. Nevertheless, we recognized that relying solely on this approach did not provide the necessary degree of abstraction for developers to build and extend the Autonomous World (AW) beyond Eternum, which has consistently been our primary design goal. It's important to acknowledge that numerous teams within Starknet have been advocating for autonomous worlds for quite some time, with notable implementations by Guilty Gyoza of Topology, the Influence team and Dope Wars RYO. Subjectively speaking, Starknet boasts the highest concentration of exceptional builders across the entire crypto universe, and with Cairo 1.0 beautiful abstraction it will continue to be. It is worth noting that the EVM ecosystem is undergoing rapid evolution. As a result, various shapes and forms of Autonomous Worlds (AWs) will emerge in many environments, EVM and Cairo VM. Our chosen path involves non-EVM but EVM compatibility with Starknet and Cairo as Cairo Virtual Machine provides interesting isomorphic approach to constructing verifiable compute. It is possible run the VM in WASM, custom app chains running Substrate or Starknet itself. There is a flourishing ecosystem emerging around WASM and Cairo, and we are at the heart of it. Enter Dojo The advent of MUD and the Lattices team adoption of an Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern written in Solidity prompted us to reevaluate our approach to Eternum. In late November, the Realms team, together with Cartridge and Briq, started collaborating on a Cairo 1.0 onchain gaming toolchain called Dojo, heavily built upon the learnings of MUD. What is Dojo? Dojo is a dedicated Rust and Cairo 1.0 toolchain designed for terraforming Autonomous Worlds, bearing a close resemblance to MUD in terms of abstraction, albeit not an exact 1:1 match. Owing to the outstanding work accomplished by the Cairo 1.0 team, Dojo effectively eliminates much of the contract boilerplate associated with writing systems and components. All the work of structuring queries and mutating the world is consolidated into a set of easy to understand commands. Over the coming months tutorials on how these specifically work will be released for developers to build upon. Dojo's primary objective is to empower developers to begin building on Autonomous Worlds within a matter of hours, as opposed to months, thus expediting the onboarding process and promoting growth in the Realms Autonomous World and other AWs. By having worlds adhere to a common set of standards for components and systems, these elements can be efficiently shared across different worlds. This advantage doesn't even factor in the shared auditing, backend engineering, and other intricate work involved in constructing these worlds. Dojo is an open-source project looking for active contributors, if you love games, Rust or Cairo - join the discord. Eternum and Dojo While the Realms: Eternum Developer Alpha currently operates on a modular controller pattern, with an indexer and a web client for testing game features, we plan to migrate the game to the Dojo stack. This transition aims to enhance the development velocity and facilitate shared engineering resources, ultimately empowering developers to contribute more effectively to the world's expansion. While this transition might appear to be a significant shift, we already have most of the client design in place, so the primary focus will be on contract work in Cairo 1, from which we intended to migrate regardless. This highlights the beauty of onchain games – their headless nature! The ability to effortlessly swap out contracts and clients allows for flexibility and adaptability in a shapeshifting world. Eternum, aspires to endure alongside Ethereum itself. Its final form will inevitably differ from its current state, embodying the essence of an Autonomous World—unbridled, unconstrained, and permissionless.",

    "The Lordship Protocol 9/14/2024 by Secretive The Lordship Protocol is the core economic foundation of the Realms World. Today it is live and all legacy $Lords are unlocked for instant staking into the protocol. The Lordship Protocol The Lordship Protocol and the final 'legacy' $Lords unlock Introducing The Lordship Protocol and veLords The protocol has a bespoke architecture to promote the growth and alignment of the Realms World ecosystem. The system has been custom-built on Starknet by Realms contributors and is already receiving fees from game entries. You can read the details of the veLords system including voting power, emissions and early withdrawal penalties here.  What it means for protocol users A $Lords token holder can now stake their $Lords tokens into the Lords Protocol. They choose how long to lock their $Lords and in return receive a protocol emission reward rate, and veLords tokens. The protocol emissions are made up of a percentage of game fees and a percentage of marketplace fees. veLords tokens will have their own utility for governance of protocol emissions in an upcoming upgrade.  If you are a Realms NFT holder head to Realms.World Account Page now. You will be able to claim all L1 'legacy' $Lords from all three epochs of the galleon. There will be no more emissions unlocked on L1, all future claims are made on L2 for staked Realms NFTs that have been delegated for DAO governance. As of right now all $Lords emissions from staking are available.  What it means for the Realms ecosystem The introduction of veLords is part of the DAO's strategy to establish a fully onchain gaming ecosystem built by aligned but independent entities, like game studios, supported by a community and members.  $Lords locked for veLords will, in future updates, give the bearer the right to direct emissions from the DAO to scale successful games. This is phase one of rolling releases of the lordship protocol. This initial release focuses on funneling game fees. The following releases will include, LP fee capture within the system, Game incentives and a $Lords distribution mechanism.  Loot Survivor x veLords The first game to support veLords is Loot Survivor. A percentage of $Lords token used to play the game are sent to the veLords pool, and then split among participants in the Lordship Protocol. Studios aligned to the DAO will take a similar path, unlocking benefits for gamers, studio and protocol participants.  How to claim and stake Go to the accounts page on Realms.World and follow the instructions. You will need an L2 wallet for Starknet - both Argent and Braavos are supported. The longer you lock the more $Lords rewards and more voting power. There is a linear relationship between lock duration and protocol emissions. The contracts have been peer reviewed, and a member of the development team is by trade an auditor. The veLords contract to add to your Starknet wallet is:  0x47230028629128ac5bfbb384d32f925e70e329b624fc5d82e9c60f5746795cd  To review the Lords Tokenomics, click here.",

Part of this was making them radically open, explicitly releasing all possible copyrights. This created the cc0 (creative commons zero) NFT movement in which creators release their works with the goal being for others to steal them for whatever purposes they want to put them to. Since their release, a large community has formed around them. This community has treated the NFTs as a sort of archelogical discovery of artifacts from a fantasy world and has set about examining them to find patterns and any clues that yield information about the world to which they belong. That established a sort of baseline set of facts about the world. From there many set about filling in color for the world inventing stories and characters to fill out the world.
