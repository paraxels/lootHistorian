    "Loot is an NFT project created by Dom Hoffman, released on August 27, 2021. They were free and claimable by anyone. The original collection was capped at 8000 bags, but Dom subsequently released additonal variations of Loot that had no supply cap. More Loot (technically Temporal Loot) is also free and releases more loot bags over time. Synthetic Loot has an unlimited supply with the interesting twist that they are non-transferrable and are available for every ethereum account, so they're kind of like a characters starting items in a game",
    "Why release them as NFTs? The NFT wrapper for them can sort of be thought of as a file format. It's less important that this particular file format was chosen. The more important aspect is that these files live on the ethereum blockchain which is a community run internet resource making it so that the Loot Bags exist on a sort of internet public media commons so that they are not controlled by any person or company and therefore cannot be changed or taken down by anyone. They are designed to live permanently and independently on the internet. This design makes them more akin to physical objests that'just exist.' A real sword can out live its creator and all those who weild it and so too can the swords in Loot bags. Putting things on the blockchain in this way can take an 'idea' (needs to live in peoples minds to continue to exist), and transform it into an 'object' (exists independently from peoples knowledge of it). Because they exist in such a medium, these objects have the potential to live out the storied cycle of being forgotten and discovered over time.",

Avanesh watched them crawl across the basalt of the cave and, with wretched slowness, assemble their horrid yellow bodies into the letters of a message. /Just ignore them!” bellowed Bahadur from the darkness. He was down there somewhere, pressing his own body against the walls, systematically touching the tips of his fingers to each square inch of every edge and surface of the neat, cubical columns that contained them both. Avanesh had slept twice since the ambush, which was his only way to measure time inside the hellish tomb that had swallowed them. He hadn’t observed Bahadur sleep at all. Bahadur had been doing nothing but diligently inspecting the cavern ever since he’d sealed their only exit. Bahadur stepped into Avanesh’s torch light. He was naked except for his crown, wrapped, as ever, around his forehead. He was utterly filthy, as if every particle of dirt trapped in with them had been smeared across his broad body, caked with unending sweat. His eyes were bright as swans on a lake at midnight, and they dipped down to Avanesh, sitting where he had left him on the cavern floor. “So, what did the ants say?” he asked, almost jovially. Avanesh swept the torchlight over to the tiny blackened balls that the ants had become, though it would have been impossible for Bahadur to see them. “You said to ignore the words, so I burned them,” Avanesh said. The close heat made it difficult for him to summon even the strength to speak, but Bahadur responded with an actual roar of laughter. What a luxurious way to spend their air and their energy. “That will teach them not to write you love letters,” he said. “But I’ve got one of my own for you. It says: Avanesh, I hope this finds you well. I have some good news!” Avanesh stared at Bahadur, a towering heap of impossible muck and muscle standing above him. He recognised this tone of delivery and tensed against the inevitable but good-natured dashing of his hopes. “Turns out you were right all along. This part of the Deep Mountain IS full of adamantine. My clever crown has sniffed out a seam of it big enough to choke the sea.” He tapped his crown with a swollen, sensitive finger and it chimed prettily. “When we find a way out, we’ll come back here with the men to dig it all up and we can retire early to the Glistening Crests. Much love, Bahds.” He laughed again and rolled back into the stifling dark to resume his search for whatever sign of escape he hoped his Crown would turn up. Avanesh remained quite still in his damp little patch of ruined clothing. He wondered at which point, exactly, that Bahadur’s plan to go surveying for adamantine in the Realm of Vitriol had become his plan, but he accepted that was how it was going to be remembered between them now that Bahadur had changed history with a simple statement. He was never sure when Bahadur was deferring credit or deflecting blame. Avanesh brought his eyes back to the streak of soot on the cave wall. A new battalion of ants was marshalling their forces to create a further message. He knew he wouldn’t ignore it, as he hadn’t ignored the last one. If he closed his eyes, he could see every squirming letter of it as if it was still there on the wall. “WE ONLY WANT THE CROWN. KILL HIM AND WE WILL RELEASE YOU, AVANESH” – He didn’t know how the mage was making this happen. He thought he had seen a mage of some sort in the brief altercation at the cave’s mouth. She had been surrounded by a flash of colour, something reflective on her chest, a certain twirling of wind at her face. All he knew for sure was that he’d hit someone very hard, hard enough to break their helm, but then been knocked down. Then he had some missing time, not much, but he had been lying on his back when he saw Bahadur, daubed with blood, raise his grandmother’s sword and bring the roof down. That mage must still be lurking out there, carefully organising the ants through sixteen feet of collapsed rock. And the ants continued to crawl. There was something sickening in how the message resolved itself, how what was a seething mass of insects one moment was a clear thought in the next. Avanesh considered whether the mage was controlling the ants or controlling him. This interest in the craft of the thing was enough motivation to move Avanesh towards the wall, pluck an ant from it and inspect it closely. His demonhide gloves jolted internally as the ant made contact with the palm of his hand. A faint ringing in his mind called up something about the potential the insect had as material. As an experiment, he groped around for an ant that had not been press-ganged into the forming of words and held it for a moment by one of its long, spindly legs. This unconscripted ant made him aware of the leathery chitin of its hide, the tinting of metal possible through a certain concentration of the formic acid it held in its convoluted poison glands. It wasn’t a strong feeling. How much could one possibly build out of an ant? But the messenger ants from the wall gave him the sense of songs, of persuasion, of thought projected. They were possessed of a different sort of material, the material of language. He retreated to his nest of rags opposite the wall. While it was possible for a mage to influence a mind at a distance, Avanesh’s gloves could not be fooled or befuddled or swayed. The only control the mage had over him was from the words on the wall. He braced himself for the next message. “HE DOOMED YOU BOTH.” The heat of the Earth seemed to flare more intensely within Avanesh’s face for an instant. Brave, fearless Bahadur hadn’t thought much of the risks of trespassing, of robbing precious metals from under the noses of people who would take that as no small slight. He never knew what it meant to feel invincible, but being with Bahadur had allowed him to inhale those vapours from time to time. “BUT WE WILL RESCUE YOU.” He remembered feeling confident, before his first sleep, that the crown would find a way out for them. Bahadur could train it to see the gas mixture of fresh air, or the green of a leaf, and then it was a matter of homing in on the signal. But this optimism fell in time with Bahadur’s ever deeper plumbs of the cavern. If his sword hadn’t been buried under the rocks, then maybe they could have broken through to another passageway. Without it, they were forced to hunt for an exit that could not be found. “OPPORTUNITIES COME BUT DO NOT LINGER” That was a surprise. Avanesh had assumed their attackers had been of Vitriol, since theirs was the territory on which they were prospecting. But here was a line straight out of a sermon from the Order of Power. They had even less of a right to be here than he did, owing to recent events. So why had they been there? “YOU ARE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US MASTER CRAFTSMAN OF PERFECTION” Avanesh allowed a flicker of pride to light the space under his ribs. So their work had been noticed. Quite far afield. Bahadur had sourced the finest materials for Avanesh to forge into tools of exquisite manufacture, and at some point the Order of Power had been made aware. He tried to recall the fragmented details of the ambush. Had it been an attack or a heavily negotiated recruitment drive? He thought about what the Order of Power could do with Bahadur’s crown. With their resources they could turn the world inside out. All that was buried and hidden would be brought to light, where it could be seen and studied. The useless would be transformed into the useful. “WHEN WE HEAR YOUR CAPTOR’S PULSE STOP WE WILL PULL YOU OUT.” Avanesh wondered about the truthfulness of the messages. He didn’t know what powers the mage had at her command, or if she had confederates with her now. He entertained a thought, then crawled forward and grabbed a handful of ants out of the word “WILL.” They were unusually still in his cupped fist. He focused on his gloves and searched for a sense of what he could make out of the word. He was surprised to discover that the word was solid, it was dependable. He scooped up the ants making other words, finally coming round to “CAPTOR,” which made his heart sink lower than he thought it could go. He slumped to the rough floor. The words were true. It was clear from the point of view of an outsider that Bahadur had been the first to strike the delegation from the Order, had imprisoned them behind the rocks and was going to kill him while frittering away their few remaining minutes on a futile search for nothing. He remained almost motionless until the ants skittered from his hand and returned to the wall. “WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION EASIER FOR YOU.” Avanesh let that thought run up and down his overheated mind. The message dissolved and its constituents went about their usual ant business. The distribution of pain and numbness in Avanesh’s body, as well as the scattering of debris from his final torch, told him he had been watching these messages slowly form and fade for hours. He gradually became aware that Bahadur was calling to him. “Come here and look at what we’ve found!” Avanesh unfolded his body, massaged out the pain and groped about in the fading light for his maul. He told himself that he needed it as a crutch for his unsteady legs, but mostly he was trying to think of how hard decisions could be made easier. He didn’t have to stumble much of a distance towards Bahadur’s booms before he heard the water. Bahadur was bathing in a thin trickle falling from the roof of the cave. The accumulated muck of the underground was streaming from his body, leaving rivulets of his umber flesh to reflect the torchlight. Avanesh smelled brine and iodine. That was seawater coming in. As he leaned heavily on his maul and watched Bahadur clean himself, he saw the trickle become a stream, and then a flow. “It’s a bit less warm than we are, and that’s refreshment in my book,” he beamed. “Cool off and you’ll get your strength back.” Bahadur moved out of the water, his bare feet slapping on the stones. “Come now, cause we haven’t long before the entire Vibrian comes down on us.” Avanesh froze. The mage had started a flood. They no longer had the luxury of waiting for the air to run out or to die of thirst. A torturous, abstract death had been replaced by a very sudden and very material one. He clenched and unclenched his fists. He felt the mist and doom and dark of the atmosphere that submerged him. He felt the rising water and the dead end before them. He felt Bahadur’s hidden panic and his own hidden fury. He felt the way out and he felt the opportunity. He stepped towards the shower and then spun towards Bahadur. His maul made contact with Bahadur’s crown and it fell from his head. It fluttered and gasped on the wet floor, spraying Avanesh’s shins as it tried to tie itself into knots. He had dropped the torch and stared wide-eyed into the dark where Bahadur had been. Then he felt gentle pressure on his forearms and Bahadur’s breath falling on his face as they sank together to the ground. Sat face to face with Bahadur, Avanesh twisted his weapon hand free, raised the maul again and closed his eyes. And Bahadur brought Avanesh’s empty hand up to his face, so Avanesh could again understand the material he was working with. It was flesh and blood and thought and love. There was hope he could use and help he could take. “The water, the water made it easier to focus,” whispered Bahadur. “I found a crack in the ceiling, Avvie.” Avanesh dropped the maul. His mouth opened in a silent, dry yelp of anguish. “You could wriggle through, and find help maybe,” slurred Bahadur. Avanesh allowed himself to be led a short distance in the darkness, to be lifted, and pushed. His hands found a sharp edge in the rock and, as he felt its interior, his gloves told him how to turn this passage into his escape. Suddenly his feet were dangling. Bahadur had sat down again with a small splash. The pale light from his crown cast a formless shadow of Bahadur, a blot of ink to punctuate their time together. He was saying something, but Avanesh could not hear him over the rushing of water. He pulled himself up. The rocks pinned him tightly and scoured his skin. Opportunities come but do not linger. The water rose and rose and rose. – ** Report from Area of Interest 1854 (Fallen Cavern) by Procurer Sayadaw to the Judge of the Reliquary of Power. ** Our will was diverted. Agent Kader is injured.

It declared Kader to be infirm of mind due to her injuries and her badge would be retired. It stated that officers of the Reliquary would be dispatched to confiscate her equipment. Kader protested weakly while the mage, Sayadaw, spat a curse of Vitriol. Neither reaction was of any interest to the homunculus, which turned its back to the useless warrior and zipped away down the heavy corridors of the hospital.\r\n\r\nSayadaw wanted to snatch the foul little animalcule from flight and stamp it underfoot, though she understood perfectly well that this would lead to an outcome more certain than suicide. So she allowed it to flit by her face and to return intact to its host, the Judge of the Reliquary of Power. She instead channelled her urge to violence towards her face, where it shone from her eyes.\r\n\r\nKader folded under Sayadaw’s bifurcated glare. The one visible eye was terrible enough, but Kader could see an extraordinary pulsating of sickly colour refracted through Sayadaw’s eyepiece. She hung her head, which would not stop ringing. She felt like she would vomit again, though her stomach was empty.\r\n“I’m sorry, Procurer Sayadaw,” she said, “You needed me.” she said.\r\n“I needed your shoes,” hissed the mage, and stamped off to her transport.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nAfter being carried back to Kezkiisch Library, Sayadaw found that she was in a better mood. The rhythm and noise of the ride had allowed her mind to unspool and her thoughts to reweave. She watched the smog-covered buildings of her home rattle by, and when she closed one eye she saw the dull and frightened colours of the people walking by, the dance of the sky to the rays of the setting sun. Somewhere between the hospital and the Library, her view of the situation in which she found herself had been cleared.\r\n\r\nShe could no longer use Kader, or her Boots, even though she had made it clear to the Judge that these were instrumental to her goal. Kader would likely be sent to whatever knacker’s yard they reserved for broken warriors and her Boots were under containment at the hospital waiting for the jurats to spirit them away. Sayadaw knew that even if she were defiant enough to steal them without being seen, she wouldn’t have been able to use them in any meaningful way. Kader had been trained well in their operation and when she wore them she could walk through solid rock as if it was sand. Sayadaw imagined that, were she to don the Boots, she would drown in the ground before she was able to put one foot in front of another. No, the Judge’s beastly little creature had ended that entire line of action. She had to find another way to enter the collapsed cave and collect her prizes.\r\n\r\nFor Procurer Sayadaw had spent the last eight months with her very keen eye fixed to two objects of her fancy. She had chosen them carefully, being useful enough that the Reliquary would open its purse-strings to aid their recovery, but obscure enough that she could claim a grant for their personal use without competition. She was pursuing Victory Bite, a Crown that could find things, and a pair of Gloves named Tempest Bender, that could make things. They had been in the possession of a couple, both of whom were scurrying up and down the Vibrian Coast inexpertly seeking their fortune. Wherever they went, she had paid to loosen tongues and sent her friends in the Order of Vitriol to make inquiries. When she had at last received intelligence that the pair were on their way to explore a deep network of caverns in Haukpiukpipi, she acted quickly. The caves were a short journey from her base at the Library, so she activated Kader, who was supposed to be a warrior without peer, and bustled out on the next wind to catch the treasure-hunters unaware. Time was of the essence, as the Archivists of the Scrollhouse were also interested in the activities of this couple, which were taking place almost on their doorstep. Her supervisors at the Reliquary and the Masters of the Archive were locked in a long-running game of acquisitions which had been accelerating in the past year. Both powers were sending their agents further and deeper into the Realms in their hope of gobbling up all of the world’s inexplicable and magical items. These agents were coming into open conflict with each other more often. Sayadaw’s background in the realms south of the Archive had served her well, allowing her to snatch precious things from right under Master Flololömen’s nose. If she were to possess Victory Bite, she could root out every magical trinket in the Northern hemisphere before the Archive caught so much as a sniff. With the Tempest Bender gloves, she could jury-rig whatever she needed in the field without relying on support and resupply from the Reliquary. Her climb through the ranks of the Order of Power, already precipitous, would become an outright ascension.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nSayadaw found the treasure-hunters easily in the dark. The click-clacking of metal in their blood was as bright as a beacon. There was amusement in getting to see them in person, for she had gathered a certain familiarity with them while she had been tracing their movements across the country. One was a squirrely, pretentious warrior and the other was a hunter who’d have been happier pulling a plough. She certainly felt that she had learned enough about their characters to be able to talk them into selling their Gloves and Crown. She would appeal to the warrior’s vanity and the hunter’s eagerness to please. Kader would supply an implied threat and would catch them if they bolted.\r\n\r\nBut before Sayadaw could even begin her pitch, the little one leapt up, swung his maul and shattered Kader’s helm. Sayadaw responded with violence of her own, but then the massive hunter pulled a legendary Sword out of nowhere and brought down the roof of the cave with one astonishing thunderclap. Sayadaw was left empty-handed, deep underground, with a stricken Kader weeping at her feet.\r\n\r\nAs perplexing as it was to learn that Gloom Bender of Reflection, a Sword thought lost before the Archive was built, had been in the hands of a grubby farmboy, Sayadaw knew that the Sword would save her. Her report on its presence in that cave was able to convince the Judge of the Reliquary that the Sword had been her true goal all along. It was nerve-wracking work to convince the Judge of anything on account of the long pauses between one’s statement and the Judge’s response. It took two days for one of the Judge’s homunculi to fly between Haukpiukpip and the glimmering fjords of Mapkin, where it relayed her words to the man himself, and then two more days for one to return with a fresh imprint of the Judge’s mind. Four days of pacing beside Kader, who woke only occasionally, to mewl and apologise.\r\n\r\nBut with the news of the Sword, the Judge shed grace upon her blunder. Punishment had been deferred to Kaden, whose condition grew worse by the day. There was no place for an enfeebled warrior in the Order of Power, and there would be no place for an eccentric mage overrunning her expenses if she didn’t deliver the Sword before the close of Icewhile.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nSayadaw swept into the research wing of the Library, dealing out instructions to the clerks like playing cards. They coaxed Curator Ozige from her collections and brought her to Sayadaw’s office in the Western tower.\r\n“What animal can dig through igneous rock?” Sayadaw asked. Ozige responded at first with an amused snort. She had not seen Sayadaw for weeks and, despite herself, had been expecting at least a short exchange of updates and well-wishes before they proceeded with business. Ozige wondered how consciously Sayadaw was affecting the brusque manner they favoured in the Order of Power. Ozige still remembered the Sayadaw who practised the long, probing greetings of the Order of Vitriol.\r\n“I happen to have papers and specimens of several taxa that fit the description. Could you perhaps try to be more precise?” Ozige clucked.\r\n“It must be able to survive in salt water,” said Sayadaw, as if that was obvious. Ozige appreciated the combatitative tone, and went to collect the relevant materials for her old student.\r\n\r\nThough Sayadaw had been invited to cross the bridge over the Great Schism to join the Order of Power, she had not forgotten the fundamentals of the teachings of Vitriol. The Order of Vitriol kept an extensive collection of some of the most detailed anatomical texts in the world. To know the entirety of something is to intimately understand its limitations and Vitriol craved ever more specific and precise information about the natural world to feed its desire for ever more specific and precise criticism of human weakness. From the study of nameless invertebrates and long-dead fungus, the Order could determine better than anyone how each quality of a person can be ranked among the endless categories of life. The discovery of a new species, however obscure or familiar, was joyful news to the people taught in the way of Vitriol. It meant they could wield a new tool of unflattering comparison against their friends and families, add new words to their vocabulary of ridicule. As a child, Sayadaw had been taught by Ozige and others the complex inner workings of creatures most people had never heard of. She could inform someone that their breathing was as laboured as a breed of ox known for natal obesity. With one look at a face of a suitor, she could estimate the size of the population of Demodex mites responsible for each blotch and blemish.\r\n\r\nAnd so Sayadaw pored over the centuries of notes and drawings that Ozige had gathered for her. They detailed the inner workings of a species of benthic echinoids that grazed on wood and subsurface gravel. Fully grown, each individual was about the size of a curled thumb, but the zinc-tipped teeth that ringed the chimney of their lantern mouth were powerful. In numbers, they could reduce a sunken tree trunk to splinters in a surprisingly short time. Ozige had chosen a good candidate to solve Sayadaw’s problem, and had provided the maps and charts of the creature’s nervous system. These were vital, for Sayadaw wished to control the movement and behaviour of the echinoids using the Amulet that Ozige had entrusted to her. It had been Ozige’s for her entire life, but the Curator had scarcely understood the true extent of its usefulness before she lent it to her talented student for practice. Ozige had believed the Amulet to be a scarecrow - something that could startle small minds at a distance, make them yelp and flee as though they had received a static shock. But in the hands of Sayadaw, who could see the colours of everything through her eyepiece, the Amulet was a vehicle of subtle and intentional control. Sayadaw could accomplish within minutes what a circus lion-tamer could in weeks. Her graduate thesis took the unusual form of a performance of The Eighth Hymn of Vitriol sung by a flock of dogwoods perched on the gutters of the school building. The recruiter from the Order of Power came looking for her soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nFrom reading the texts, Sayadaw knew that the echinoids would be a challenge to control and coordinate. She needed to practice, so she instructed an orderly to bring her a cluster of live specimens. She peered into the jar, adjusted her eyepiece and examined the ebb and flow within them, the salt moving in and out of the fibres of their nerves expressed as musical scintillations through the lens. The patterns matched well with what she had learned from the texts. Each spine of their radial bodies was packed with nervous tissue, ending with a long and sensitive foot. An individual had dozens of feet, and each foot was its own inquisitive, hungry set of impulses. She tutted. It would be difficult to control an animal with such a distributed mind. The urchins reminded her of the Judge’s scattered and asynchronous consciousness. She had never met the man in person but had heard that he was as pleasant company as a roiling beehive.\r\n\r\nShe tapped a beat on her Amulet until she found the register of the animal’s thoughts. She visualised herself addressing a hall full of very distracted, very young children. Every child was a foot and each child needed to be constantly reminded of their purpose and direction or they would wander off, unbalancing the whole body, or even wrench themselves from their socket. She introduced a lump of basalt into the jar and compelled the urchins to move towards it and rasp it into sludge. Their jaw strength was up to the task, though the animals very much did not want to. With even a small piece of rock the urchins had cracked tests and splintered teeth. The attrition rate would be high.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Sayadaw went out with Ozige to bully some fishermen. Kezkiisch’s narrow harbour was busy at all hours of the day and night with exchanges of people and goods across the Vibrian to Yunyun and the Hluhah islands. Ozige had worked with many of the regulars at the harbour and knew which boats would be best equipped for the job at hand, so she led the way down the maze of wooden jetties and Sayadaw worked hard to ignore the brilliance of ionised spray scattered out by the sea.\r\n\r\nOzige, striding just ahead of her, snapped her fingers. “You are distracted, Sayadaw. When you look at too much you see too little,” she said, and Sayadaw felt thirteen years old again. She was a senior Procurer for an office within the Order of Power known and feared across the world, but in that moment she was caught between the rebellious act of keeping her eyepiece on and the wise acceptance of Ozige’s advice. “Have you made an accurate estimation of the total weight of the echinoids required to clear the blockage?” sniffed the Curator. They had arrived at a vessel whose owner often gathered specimens for the Library. It was a softwood coracle, sealed with tar, one of the larger such boats in the harbour. Sayadaw, feeling under pressure, removed her eyepiece and made some quick calculations. She arrived at the conclusion that she would need three full loads of the boat in question.\r\n\r\n“And in what amount of time will you complete the work?” asked Ozige. Sayadaw believed it would take no more than two days. Ozige chewed her lip as she considered this. She spoke to the fisherman in the latest cipher of Vitriol, and Sayadaw fidgeted anxiously at being out of date. Ozige handed the stout man one of her specimens of the urchin they wanted. It was quite dead, and in bad condition after Sayadaw’s examinations, but he recognised it with no trouble. In the realm of Spezlaas there was no greater authority than a Curator of the Kezkiisch Library but even the most obsequious layman might baulk at a request to dredge fourteen tons of xylophagic urchin from the sea bed. Ozige’s fisherman did no such thing, and went about consulting the network of cousins to which he belonged to find the correct mesh of net for catching urchins. Ozige turned to Sayadaw with eyes like an owl’s during a predatory stoop. “That is too slow. Gathering fourteen tons will take more than a day. The Archive has been making enquiries. An agent of the Scrollhouse was seen at the hospital and turned up at the Library this morning,” she said and then, after a perfect pause, “While you were asleep, like a green dune cicada waiting for the weather to change before it leaves its teneral stage to participate in the world.”\r\nSayadaw bit back a sneer and said, “If the Archive takes the Sword, the Order of Power’s response will not be gentle. They have armies that will march the entire length of the world to pry such things from dead hands,” she whispered.\r\nOzige was unimpressed. “Then you must save them the bother, so that we are not trampled under that march, Sayadaw. And to do that, you must be quicker.”\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nSayadaw found the cavern almost exactly as she had left it. No tracks had been tread in the new growth and there was no smell of campfire or the ozone emitted by most wands. There was a griffon bird scouting around for carrion as it wheeled in the sky, a reminder that her last visit had left a corpse underground, tantalisingly out of reach of the patient vulture. She adjusted her eyepiece for a long focus and surveyed the world before her. The anxious flashes of animals, the inverted waterfalls within the trees, the everpresent static hum of the soil. No busy knots of human mind, apart from the sluggish pulses from the procession of weary fishermen. She would be able to see an agent of the Archive coming from miles away.\r\n\r\nBut then she spotted an absence that was a presence. Amidst the crystalline light of the living world was a gap, within which was an inert lumpish shape of a man. It was a homunculus of the Judge, gripped to a high branch of a fleece tree opposite the cavern mouth. No blood flowed through that mass of reticulated fibres, and no sparks jumped to and fro behind its mottled skein. She swallowed the instant swell of revulsion she felt whenever she looked at its blank, colourless body, and carefully pretended not to see it. She instructed the exhausted fishermen to take their stinking, squirming load into the cavern. They dumped the urchins from the nets in the flooded pool at the foot of the cave-in. She handed each of the men a deed for a plot of land that the Order had to spare, which they accepted with barely a word. One by one, they piled into the transport and shuddered away through the valley.\r\n\r\nShe entered the cave and set about the work. Let the Judge watch through his hateful doll, she thought. It was early in the day and he would see her emerge with the Sword before sunset. She sat in the humid dark, which was scored by an orchestra of urchins crinkling their spines together as they settled into the water. One eye was blind in the dark, but the other saw the entangled glow of the creatures as they moved over and under each other. She focused on the nearest individual, found the play of its mind circling the mouth and stretching down the length of each searching spine. She held her Amulet in her right hand and tapped on it with the fingers on her right. Each tap initiated pizoelectric fields from within the glass, which she made overlap with each other until they matched the patterns of the fields emanating from the urchin.\r\n\r\nShe tuned in to the switches and gates and circuits that the creature used to move and feel and understand. An application of a simple pressure on the senses told the urchin that there was an irresistible source of food lying deeper within the cavern. Another touch told it that its companions were not as stressed and panicked as it had previously assessed. Another, and it realised that it was, in fact, alone. It could enjoy a wide berth of space and, if it hurried, would certainly be the first one to reach the food, a victory that would make the meal taste all the sweeter.\r\n\r\nSayadaw, as drum major, led her band to march up to the face of the cave-in and assemble on a space slightly larger in circumference than the guard of a sword. There they could gorge themselves on the most delicious meal of lightly-rotted chalkwillow they have ever had until they were too injured to continue. At this point they would gracefully roll to the side and pass the meal along to a fresher set of jaws.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw that the swarm had detected the sharp tang of metal in the water, she directed them to chew in that direction. Slowly but surely, molecule by molecule, the Sword Gloom Bender revealed itself. It took the work of hours for the urchins to gnaw it loose. They wedged themselves under the Sword in the hollow they had made. With careful coordination they could pass it from delicate foot to delicate foot all the way back to Sayadaw. But Sayadaw had her sights set further into the cave. The Sword was what the Judge wanted, but her plans all relied on her finding the Demon Crown, Victory Bite.\r\n\r\nShe felt the smell of bloated human remains, which was a different sensation on the feet of the urchins than it would have been on her nose. To a person, the scent of death is immediately alarming, an urgency propelled by disgust. But the urchins had no interest in meat of any kind, so Sayadaw had to continually replace that disinterest with a different emotion. When, at last, the cave-in was breached, Sayadaw strained the tiny eyes on the end of each tube foot to look for the pale fluorescence emitted by the Crown. She convinced them that it was the blessed light of day, the sun rising behind the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe real sun was beginning to fall in the sky. Sayadaw had been sat, rigid, on the floor of the cave for eight hours. On the journey up, she had wolfed down the lunch of dried figs and tabouleh dumplings that Ozige had packed for her. She was shivering from hunger despite the heat. She had sweat through her clothes and had bundled them into a stinking ball beside her. Her bare feet were submerged in the filthy saltwater, which had been a coolant in the first hour but had been heated above the temperature of her blood. Her face was cramped from squinting through her eyepiece. Her entire body would ache if she allowed herself to feel it, but was hypnotised by the rhythm of the million tube feet: roll, stretch, feel, adhere, roll, over and over. She scarcely registered when the urchins at last found the Crown. They conveyed it, inch by inch, over a carpet of their bodies, towards her.\r\n\r\nAt last the Sword emerged from the fist-sized hole and the sea urchins presented it to her. Gloom Bender had been the conclusion of ancient wars, the dream of empires, but to Sayadaw it looked comical, like a stick inelegantly held in a dog’s mouth. Blinded by sweat and exhaustion, she took the Sword from the cortege, set it down on the pile of her clothes, grit her teeth and concentrated on bringing the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe sun began to set when the first corner of the Crown’s fabric peeked through the borehole. She let out a raspy shout of triumph, abruptly stood and was about to wade through the thicket of urchins to grab it with her own hands before reason intruded and she stopped herself. Her body was in agony. The urchins stopped, confused. She collected herself and began tapping on the Amulet again when Kader stepped through the wall and picked up Gloom Bender from the wet heap she’d left it on.\r\n\r\nSayadaw turned her head so quickly that her eyepiece fell to the floor. She could only make out the outline of Kader’s silhouette in the gloom. All at once, she tried to shout, to object, to attack. By outrage alone she would put the fully-armoured warrior in her place. She lurched one step forward and Kader took one step back, melting into the wall. Gloom Bender was gone.\r\n\r\nShe had no time to scream. She fumbled at her feet for her eyepiece, fastened it to her face, then pelted up the passageway that led outside. In her haste, she stepped on more than one urchin, spines snapping off in her feet along with a drop of venom, but her fury was undeterred. All she needed was to catch sight of a single heartbeat, a single impulse from Kader’s nerves, and she would dog the thief to the ends of the world.\r\n\r\nThe homunculus of the Judge was standing at the mouth of the cave, a purple shadow in the dying light. It asked her, in that approximation of a voice, what the situation was. Sayadaw, her reserves of wit and cunning depleted, only howled, and the homunculus came to the reasonable conclusion that the mission was a failure.\r\n\r\nIt rose in the air, held afloat by the ring it wore as a belt, and Sayadaw saw the supports of her world falling around her. The homunculus would report her failure to the Judge. Her badge of the Reliquary would be retired. They would take her eyepiece, a loss equal to the plucking of her actual eyeball. She would be excommunicated from the Order of Power. Ozige would be struck down by disappointment and shame. The Order of Power would mobilise against the Archive, and when they cracked open its secrets they would fall upon the Library like a thunderbolt. Nothing would remain of Sayadaw’s past, her home, or her future.\r\n\r\nShe watched in horror as the homunculus flew towards the South. There was no time for finesse. She clawed at her Amulet, ensnared the mind of the griffon bird and used it as a missile to swat the homunculus to the ground.\r\n\r\nShe padded over to the stunned brownie on swollen feet. It lay in the dust beside the large carrion bird, which twitched its broken wings as it fitted on its back. Sayadaw took the homunculus from the ground, removed the ring from its waist, and wrung the abomination out like a wet cloth. She took it back into the cave and tossed it to the urchins and then stared into nothing as she advised them to devour the remains. The swarm shuffled the Crown over to her, seeming embarrassed. She held it loosely in her hand and released the urchins. They were free now. They could die here in the cave along with the scores of their worn-out siblings. They could die along with the hunter she had taken the Crown from, along with her entire vision of herself and her career.\r\n\r\nShe slipped the Crown on her head, dressed in her sodden clothes, and limped outside. The air was cool and the roof of the sky was impossibly tall. She had to find a new way forward. But the Crown Victory Bite could find anything.\r\n\r\nShe returned to the Library with a new plan.\r\n}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

He held up his palm, which told his charge it was time to make camp for the day. He had passed through this place many times, and it held no terror for him. He liked it very much, as it was quiet and he knew of dozens of high places where he could stand and regard the scenery as he photosynthesised through the hours of daylight.\r\n\r\nThe Wanderer’s name was Odavwaro óyan Ediruo, and his charge during this particular crossing of the necropolis was a young mage named Sayadaw. She had recently graduated from a convent school run by Sisters of the Order of Vitriol. Sayadaw watched Odavwaro as he climbed up onto a towering mound of mulch, using vines as nimble handholds, then assumed his lookout at its top. He planted his feet, toes spread wide, his cloak of grass with the hood turned up, draped over the length of his body, and he became quite still. He gazed abstractedly down at the village that had been swallowed by tragedy. Below him were mouldering frames of buildings, dotted by standing stones in their tell-tale pattern. Above him was the dawn, and the sea kneeling before the curve of the horizon. He intended to not move again until evening.\r\n\r\nSayadaw had witnessed this routine every morning of their journey together. That journey was less than halfway done, but it was the longest on which Sayadaw had ever been. It was not an especially long one for Odavwaro, who had walked up and down the length and breadth of the world more times than he could recollect. It was the job of a Wanderer to find exceptional people like Sayadaw and then offer to accompany them to the Realms of Power. Their journey had begun at Sayadaw’s home in the Realm of Spezlaas and would end at the Tides of Tears in the South, where she would be installed at one of the ambitious academies run by the Order of Power. There she could continue her training among the other wunderkinds that the Order had plucked from the trees of the world.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\n​​Sayadaw watched Odavwaro for a moment longer as she drained her water flask and plotted out the things that needed to be done during the scrap of morning she had before she needed to sleep. She took out her eyeglass and fastened it to her head. The tube of the eyeglass contained a ring, and when light passed through its mounting it was changed. So when she looked at Odavwaro through it, she saw the pale light of sunrise ripple across Odavwaro’s cloak as thousands of billowing colours. The cloak translated the light into waves down each stalk of long grass like the untwisting of thousands of threads of the finest gossamer. This is how any plant looked in the sunlight when seen through Sayadaw’s eyepiece, but she had yet to become accustomed to the process being in the shape of a man. She noticed that Odavwaro was flowering that day, and tiny buds were emerging from their sheathes on his back. Perhaps that was why he had been especially taciturn for the past few nights. She was undergoing a flowering of a more mammalian type, so she left Odavwaro standing there and found a clump of dense shrubs that provided some privacy from him and the empty town. She removed her wool bandage and swapped it for a clean one. She stamped off to find somewhere to wash.\r\n\r\nOdavwaro heard Sayadaw’s footsteps recede for a considerable distance even over the distant roar of the sea. With his hood up, he could hear for miles around. He had discovered Sayadaw for the first time in exactly this way - by simply waiting in the sun and listening carefully. In the case of Sayadaw, he had been standing on a grassy knoll beside a road in the Realm of Spezlaas when he heard an inexplicable burst of birdsong. While Odavwaro was very tall, and had features rarely seen in that part of the world, he was rarely noticed when he stood out in the open. He made no sound except for the rustling of his cloak and a tiny periodic slurp when he drank the sap that the cloak had made for him. He moved only with the currents of the wind, which a sensible eye was trained to ignore. Only people who knew the area well would spot him, and very few of them had the courage to approach him, though if they did he was perfectly polite according to the rules of all the cultures he wandered through. All of this made him an excellent spy, especially when combined with the keen hearing granted to him by the hood of his cloak. When he stood in the sun on a tall ledge or atop a hill, quite out of anyone’s way, his entire body became an ear. In any given week he heard enough conversations, arguments, plots, gossip, confessions and affairs to fill a library. But while Odavwaro very much enjoyed hearing what people had to say, he kept almost all of it to himself, except for any hints of someone who had found the use of a remnant of the Old War.\r\n\r\nThe Order of Power swept these remnants up from every Realm into which it had sunk its claws. In this, it was much like any of the other Orders that cast their shade across the Earth like looming clouds. But the philosophy of the Order of Power was focused around the cult of the individual and that focus allowed its elders to see that the wielder was often more important than the tool. So while the Archive of the Order of Vitriol isolated the remnants for endless study, and the Royal Houses of the Order of Protection threw them in their vaults and the Order of the Twins bestowed them as gifts to their faithful, the Order of Power preferred to look for people. People who already knew the subtleties of the remnants they possessed, and the best way to put them to use.\r\n\r\nSayadaw had been given such a remnant, fashioned into an Amulet, to train with at her school. She had used it to make a flock of birds whistle a folk song, which Odavwavo heard while he was standing out in the thin Northern sun. He moved closer to the school and discovered, in his utterly passive way, enough about Sayadaw’s skill with the Amulet that he decided to present to her one of the signed and sealed letters from his employers. She was in many ways a perfect candidate - her command of the Amulet was linked to her deep connection with her eyepiece, which was likely a remnant as well. Through her scope, she could see the vital dance of lights that happened inside living things and, with the Amulet, she could tap out her own tune and change the steps of that internal dance from the outside. People in her village spoke of her often, and with admiration, though Sayadaw herself spoke to few of them. Her House was far from destitute but her home was empty, and a sympathetic Sister from the Order of Vitriol would see the opportunity that came from Odavwavo’s letter.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nBeing a charge of Odavwaro the Wanderer did have one persistent drawback - he was slow to remember that other people needed to eat. He had never offered any of them a draw on the well-bitten reeds that fed from his cloak to his mouth, and none had ever asked for it. He did eat with his family when he returned to them for the holiday period but only a small amount, for most foods tasted bitter compared to the nutritious elixir provided by his cloak.\r\n\r\nSo the next thing on Sayadaw’s mind was to find breakfast. Being a creature of the village, she wasn’t much of an outdoorsman, but her marvellous sense of sight helped her forage with some efficiency. Eggs were an easy target because the hard work of building an animal produced a particularly bright soup of lights. She discovered a clearing near a massive gnarled tree surrounded by what appeared to be a garden of large stones. The stones were sunk partway into the soft ground, and covered entirely with moss and creepers so that they looked like tired soldiers guarding mud. Many of those soldier-shapes wore nests as their helm, and those helms seemed like crowns, studded with shining egg-shaped gems, when seen through her eyepiece. She stepped onto one of the broader, flatter stones and leaned across to a taller one so she could pluck two eggs from the nest. As she jumped down, her feet kicked away a chunk of muck from the stone she’d been standing on. Underneath the muck was someone’s hand.\r\n\r\nSayadaw checked with her eyepiece and saw that the hand was not alive. It was, rather, the sculpture of a hand. She gingerly kicked more moss and algae from the stone and found that the hand was clutching a head. The stone on which she had stood to steal eggs was a statue of a woman on her knees, cowering in fear, feebly protecting herself from an unseen assailant. Sayadaw stood, egg held in each hand, and regarded this crystalised moment of horror that had travelled from the past into her current time. Emotions rose within her, but she felt curiosity bob up to the surface of her mind before fear, revulsion or pity.\r\n\r\nShe set her eggs down, found a small stone buried among the undergrowth, and carefully struck the statue of the woman. The blow sent a wave of excitation through the stone that Sayadaw could see as colours through her eyepiece. The internal structure of the rock was not that of a sculpture, but of a fossil, for the mineralized forms of the veins, sinews and bones of this woman were still intact. Sayadaw found this slightly thrilling. She looked about at the overgrown stones about her, and imagined how they might have been distributed. If they were once people, unnaturally turned to stone, they were not standing like a crowd of people would stand. There was enough distance between each statue for her to walk freely, for her to get a look at each one. She was not standing in a crowd but in a gallery. They had either been moved after their fossilisation or had been directed to stand or kneel in their specific place before it happened. She pictured how the scene might look like from above - the statues were arranged more or less radially from the great tree.\r\n\r\nShe had to pause at this point to fend off the grief of a returning mother gull, showering angry calls at the one who had robbed her nest. This prompted the other mothers to answer the call and so Sayadaw’s world was filled with screams and stink and swooping birds. She cursed the birds, then stood her ground while she tried to get a look at the thoughts flashing through their tiny heads. She fished her Amulet out from her vest and tapped on it with her practised fingers, to find the timbre of the furious minds wheeling above her head. This kind of gull didn’t range as far as Spezlaas so she fumbled the control but when she locked on to each bird she could make them relax their wings and careen into the ground. This didn’t seem to damage the gulls but it did give them something else to think about other than Sayadaw’s breakfast.\r\n\r\nShe sat in the lee of two statues embracing at the foot of the tree, and made a small fire over which she heated her little skillet. While the metal came up to temperature she examined the tree. It resembled a wild plum but with thornier leaves, and much larger than any Sayadaw had seen. All at once she realised that the tree had been trained into a particular shape - pliable branches had been bent and woven by human hands and had then hardened into wood. She studied the tree through her eyepiece as she cracked an egg onto her skillet. The tree was turning air into food just like trees and Odavwaro did, but the colours dancing from leaf to trunk to root were different. The hues were off, the intensity shifted, the connections more complicated. She rose, eyepiece clutched between her brow and cheek, and carried her remaining egg to the trunk of the tree. She cracked it above the roots and let the contents fall to the ground. This was an eccentricity of hers that she had picked up at an early age. It was a delight to her to see the soil come alive when it was offered something as immediately digestible and nutritious as an egg. Thousands of living things clamoured for the jelly seeping into the dirt, making their bargains with each other, staging ambushes and calling in alliances. It was like being able to summon up a private showing of a subterranean aurora borealis that shimmered for miles in every direction beneath her feet.\r\n\r\nBut this time, in this place, before the great tree of the fallen necropolis, the aurora reflected something different. The tiny fibres at the ends of the tree roots lurched for the prize with a selfish ferocity and speed that shocked Sayadaw. It was more like watching the orderly procession of a troop of ants than anything botanical. The root system bullied all other living components of the soil into submission, and would leave them barely a scrap to share amongst themselves.\r\n\r\nThe smell of burning caused Sayadaw to leap over to her own egg, and she let out a wail of lament at her breakfast rendered inedible. She became incandescent with fury for a hot second and her mind worked hard to find a way that Odavwaro could be to blame for the prolongation of her hunger. But, as inventive as she was, she could not calculate a way to make that blame plausible. She endeavoured to calm down by studying the tree once again. She stood above the egg she’d given to the soil and tried not to feel resentful towards it.\r\n\r\nAny other observer might have noticed that the egg was not attracting flies or worms, and was soaking into the ground a little quicker than it ought to. But Sayadaw’s practised eye, squinting through her brass tube, saw that the egg was being rapidly disassembled. The substance of it was being drawn into the roots in a tight spiral which twisted towards a black bulb deep beneath the trunk of the tree. She saw that the entire tree was growing out of that darkness. Judging by the power with which the tree was consuming the egg, she estimated that most of the tree’s body was hidden inside of the bulb. The blackness of it was unnerving to Sayadaw, as the world seen through her eyepiece was one of constant light. She knew that, to her human eyes, black meant an absence of light. She was less sure what black meant through her eyepiece. Her Amulet appeared black when not in use, but as soon as she tapped on its surface it exploded with colour - the colours which ran through metal, under the skin of living things and down the leaves of plants. The colours she saw were the secret lights that bound her body to earth, the earth to the sky and the sky to the sea.\r\n\r\nWas the black bulb underneath the tree something outside of all those things?\r\n\r\nShe removed her Amulet from its place around her neck and put it on the ground near the egg. It was a jewel of perfect opacity against the seething storm of light. If the tree was not quite a tree, then perhaps she could interfere with the pathways of its mind the way she could with animals and people. She focused on the pulses entering the black bulb. She tapped on the Amulet, sending waves of interference through the soil. She saw a faint shimmering of the waves cancelling each other out and improved her patterning. Something caught, and she felt the delight of discovery. Then, she saw the Amulet turn bright white for an instant, and her mind shattered.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nOdavwaro rocked on the balls of his heels, sipped nectar through one of the straws that connected his gut to the inner workings of his cloak, and wondered in a distant way what harm might befall Sayadaw as she walked alone through the necropolis. People for hundreds of miles in every direction had concocted stories about the place. Though the stories were often entertaining, Odavwaro had seen no substance of them during his visits there. All he saw was the usual sort of life blanketed thick over an abandoned town. Whatever had made the statues did it long ago. He often felt that the world was far less dangerous than people wanted it to be. But Odavwaro, who walked only at night, who needed no sleep, who trod lightly and carried no weapon, had in his long life seen mostly sunshine and peace.\r\n\r\nHe supposed Sayadaw could fall while exploring, or could be trapped if a house collapsed with her inside it. He had only lost one charge before - an androgyne teen who had been bitten by a water snake and drowned. Odavwaro thought of them sometimes, though he had not told anyone what had happened. The Order of Power hadn’t noticed, as Odavwaro was not in contact with his handlers except when he arrived at their door with a fresh recruit. When he had discovered the body it was too late, he had left it for the soil to reclaim and embarked on a new search.\r\n\r\nSometimes, by happenstance, he heard about what had become of a former charge of his. They all thrived at the academies, for Odavwaro was an excellent judge of character. But the Order of Power set them against each other, so they often fell victim to their former classmates when the intensity of the rivalry imposed upon them met the danger they could cause through mastery of their craft. The heartless ones and the lucky made it through, fully ordained as a hunter or warrior or mage. With a mixture of grim realisation and strange pride he felt that Sayadaw would make it too.\r\n\r\nThen he heard her scream. He turned his head a fraction of an arc towards its source. She had been making breakfast and then she had indulged in her habit of feeding an egg to the ground that Odavwaro disapproved of but never acknowledged. He had heard her burn her breakfast, express some rage and then she had gone rather quiet. He turned towards the direction of the tree as he sucked up a mouthful of honey. If anything, it would be the tree, he thought, and he strode away from his perch.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nSayadaw was both blinded and seeing too much. She could still hear the sounds of the peaceful meadow in which she stood while she saw a cacophony of shapes and movements that threatened to deafen her. Urgent winds blew within her body and she tasted saltpeter with her toes. She staggered away on weeping legs and scoured the texture of failure and fear from her arms. She swung around the pair of entwined statues and put their reassuring weight between herself and the Amulet, glowing like the Sun at the foot of the tree. The assault of sensation faded, her eyes slowly rediscovered how to see images and her hallucinations morphed into the familiar feeling of mere pain. The muscles in her ribs and back had been sprained, and she realised her throat was hoarse from shouts she had not heard. She vomited over the feet of both statues, which helped to clear her head. She sat with her back pressed against stone and haltingly forced herself to peek back at the Amulet through her eyepiece. It was once again black as night. She breathed, and then a shadow passed over her. Odavwaro was blocking the light.\r\n\r\n“What?” she snapped. Odavwaro looked at her, then at the vomit in her hair, then at the ruined egg on the skillet, then over at the tree. He sustained a long, thoughtful inhalation of air.\r\n“Your Amulet is on the ground,” he said at last. Odavwaro was not inclined to speak out loud so this observation was his version of a gigantic reprimand. Sayadaw felt it like a sharp slap across her face.\r\n“I dropped it when I was being sick,” she muttered but Odavwaro was away. He covered the ground between the statues and the Amulet in three strides then stopped to peer at it. He dropped to his knees. It was a ridiculous thing to see someone so tall bend themselves to be so close to the ground. His knees thrust out like lances and his cloak fell across the ground like an outstretched palm going to seed. He produced a finger and hovered it over the cold surface of the glass.\r\n“This is what you used to make the birds sing,” he said. Sayadaw detected no question and so remained silent, though she rose to her feet and floated towards Odavwaro’s presence. He was humming The Eighth Hymn of Vitriol, the song that Sayadaw had compelled the birds to sing on the roof of her school, almost imperceptibly to the ground. Then he twisted his head towards Sayadaw, and she felt the uncanny sensation of a hillock turning to notice her.\r\n“Perhaps you are lucky the birds did not make you sing,” he said. He retracted his hand into his cloak and stood up. Sayadaw clacked her teeth once with irritation and decided to share some details.\r\n“It tried to send something to me. It wanted to command me to do something. But it didn’t know how to do it properly,” she said.\r\n“The tree?” asked Odavwaro, studying it. It was the only one of its kind he had seen, though that was not so strange by itself, as rare and singular things were often found by Wanderers.\r\n“The tree is a feeding apparatus. The main body of the creature is inside a bag buried underneath us,” she said. Odavwaro grimaced at that, for he knew about the bags that the world held hidden about itself. They could contain more than they seemed to be able to, sometimes a lot more. Remnants of the Old War were often found inside of them. Sometimes demons made lairs in them. He carefully picked up a leaf from the tree that had fallen to the ground. It wasn’t really a leaf at all, now that he thought to look at it properly. He nodded, a small gesture of recognition from one spy to another. He let the leaf fall and started to walk away. He held his palm up behind him, a signal to Sayadaw that she should follow him.\r\n“No,” she said. Odavwaro continued to walk. He was not a treasure hunter. The Order of Power paid him handsomely, and they paid him to find people. He would not gamble their safety on whatever was held in that forgotten bag.\r\n“I want to know what it wants,” called Sayadaw. Odavwaro paused. His own curiosity was rising within him.\r\n“It made you cry out. It wanted to lure in others,” he said.\r\n“But why would it do that?” asked Sayadaw. Odavwaro consulted his internal record of everything he knew about demons.\r\n“So it can eat them,” he said.\r\n“It didn’t eat you and I can’t see any bones or teeth under the ground. If it wants to eat people it hasn’t done it before.” said Sayadaw. Odavwaro turned to face her and the tree that wasn’t a tree. It was a feeding apparatus. It ate the light and whatever decomposed at its roots. It stood in the sun and waited and listened until it found someone of interest. If it found one, where would it want to take them?\r\n“How will you know what it wants?” said Odavwaro at last.\r\n“Trial and error,” said Sayadaw, her eyes flaring.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nSleep was out of the question when there was a mystery to untangle so Sayadaw conducted her experiments throughout the day while Odavwaro stood in supervision from a safe distance away. Distance was the key, as the tree demon could not send a signal to the Amulet that was strong enough to debilitate her when she stood a certain distance away. This was something she already understood from her own use of the Amulet - fine and forceful work was best accomplished up close, and the tree demon did not have the benefit of years of practice. If she tapped into the tree demon’s mind from up close, she would suffer the kind of fits that had her father confined to the asylum for most of his life. But outside of what was once the village square, she suffered only nausea and visual disturbances. The angle at which she held the Amulet was also a factor. If she held it up above her head, aimed at the sky, when she tapped into the tree demon’s lights, very little of the response was reflected back into her nerves and brain.\r\n\r\nThen came the understanding of blocking. The Amulet could not send a strong signal through the stone statues. If Sayadaw hugged one of the statues so that she was behind its dense material and the Amulet held in her hands facing the tree demon directly, she could avoid the worst effects to her senses but produce terrible muscle cramps in her exposed hands. After some coaxing she was able to bring Odavwaro close enough to demonstrate that his cloak acted as an effective shield. If he had his back turned to the Amulet then he suffered almost no ill effects from the confusion it beamed out when angled towards him.\r\n\r\nThe breakthrough came when Sayadaw saw how Odavwaro’s cloak responded when it was bathed in the Amulet’s broadcast. Through her eyepiece she saw the grass flicker and flare in a way it did in mere sunlight. He reported that it tickled some, and was mildly unpleasant but otherwise bearable. So by crouching behind one of the kneeling statues and with Odavwaro’s back positioned just so, Sayadaw could cast the tree demon’s thoughts onto his cloak like a screen that only she could see.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nThe sun was climbing down the sky when meaningful communication was established. During the experimental phase the tree demon was learning as much about sending as Sayadaw was learning about receiving. When it had reached out to Sayadaw initially, it had been trying to speak normally, and Sayadaw’s physiology was simply not compatible. Gradually it understood that it could limit the scope of its speech to produce certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that would cause photoexcitation in the leaves of green plants. And so eventually it figured out how to draw pictures with its words - pictures that Sayadaw could see on Odavwaro’s cloak through her eyepiece.\r\n\r\nThey were abstractions by necessity and crude by craft but Sayadaw could recognise that three circles, by way of their relative sizes and positions, were a depiction of the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, just as she’d learned at the nunnery. A blob moved on a trajectory between the Earth and the Moon and moved into the Earth. She had seen meteorites and even a comet when she was a girl.\r\n\r\nThe scene was repeated again and again until the scale changed. Now the meteorite blob was the focus and it was filled with squiggly asterisks that Sayadaw understood represented trees, meaning they were others like the tree demon itself. They were scattered across the curve of the Earth, inside little raindrop shapes. After that the scene became less clear. There were rows of indistinguishable asterisks, shapes that were unrecognisable, circles with lines drawn between them that resembled constellations, and then endless repetition. As evening set in the drawings became brighter and more vivid in contrast but then Odavwaro turned towards her and the screen closed. He held up his hand and signalled that it was time to walk.\r\n\r\nSayadaw was too exhausted to protest. She was aching everywhere from the unnatural movements of hugging the statues and operating the Amulet. She had completely forgotten about eating for the entire day. Her feet were leaden and her mind was both sluggish and racing. She struggled to keep pace with the Wanderer as he marched them towards their next camping spot, with its perch for him and mysteries for her. She thought about running back to the tree, of finding a shovel to dig the bag out from under it, and drawing every secret from the demon stuck inside of it: Where were the other trees, where did they come from and what did they keep inside the black bags from which they sprouted? But they walked on in darkness, guided by Odavwaro’s hearing, and even with her eyepiece she wouldn’t be able to find her way back to the necropolis at night.\r\n\r\nOdavwaro was consumed with thoughts of his own. He thought of his family, who he would see when the lunar holiday came, which was quite soon. His fee was enough that they lived lavishly in one corner of the Realms of Power, the closest thing to aristocrats that the Order could tolerate. Soon he would sit with them and hear of all their stories and triumphs and defeats and gossip. He would eat food again while his oldest grandson practised wearing Odavwaro’s cloak. Every night he would picture every one of his children and grandchildren, his nieces and nephews and all the spouses they collected. But on that night he also pictured all his former charges, most of which had also passed through the necropolis. He tried to count how many had fallen short of the Order’s exacting standards, which put failure, infirmity and sometimes kindness in the same standing as death.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nWhen dawn came again they had reached the outskirts of the coastal town of Pasapi. Sayadaw was so exhausted that she collapsed almost as soon as Odavwaro held up his palm to tell her to stop the march. He found himself showing her a secluded place to wash, and when she returned he had brewed a sweet tea from the nectar made by his cloak. She sat with him by the fire and sipped it gratefully. She noticed that it helped ease her cramps.\r\n\r\nWhen she lay down to sleep she called Odavwaro to her side. She had a strange expression on her face when she asked, “Will the Order be pleased to know I have found a bag for them, and a dormant demon?” Odavwaro was silent, which was all the response Sayadaw expected of him. He realised that her expression was strange because it was childlike, one he saw on the face of his grandchildren when they wanted an adult to be impressed by them. He felt he had something inside of himself that it was important to share.\r\n“The Order doesn’t need to know,” he said. “They have bags of their own. The secret of the necropolis is yours and mine, but I give my share to you. It is a present. It will help you, I think,”\r\nSayadaw’s face dissolved into a little frown, which remained until she presently passed into sleep. Odavwaro stayed at her side for a while. He tried to picture the trials she would face and failed, but knew that she would be better prepared than most.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose and he found a place near the edge of a cliff and stood to meet it.\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

Wherever he went, people moved away from him. If they were alone, they ran. If they were in groups, they dispersed. When he looked inside the yurts, all were empty.\r\n\r\nHis law carried no power in Sonton, but his voice did.\r\n\r\n“WE SAW THE SMOKE,” he said to a beekeeper up on the hill. She had been building a shelter against the wind. The force of the Sheriff’s voice knocked over a stack of hives. The clay pipes broke when they fell at the beekeeper’s feet. She did not look at the Sheriff and did not answer him. She ducked her head low and disappeared behind the ridge.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff stood alone and twisted a lock of his long hair between his fingertip and thumb. The Order of Fury had tolerated this tiny Republic for a generation. It had spread in all directions out of Mlunplin town and taken in refugees from the entire island until much of the Realm of Ponmom was outside of the Order’s influence. The Republic wanted to be ignored by the Order, and the Order was content to ignore it. But then the Brothers had seen the chimneys, and then the Worm, and knew that it was past time to bring the Republic to heel.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff returned to his battleforged camel and filled her feedbag. He fastened her ear protectors and adjusted his necklace. He turned his voice up as loud as he would dare it to go. He walked to the spot he perceived to be the nucleus of the village of Sonton: a circle of chopped stumps attached around an iron stove. He spoke.\r\n\r\n“I HOLD A WARRANT FROM THE ORDER. I WILL INSPECT THE IRON WORM.”\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nThere were hundreds of Free Republics that clung like lichen to the edges of the world. They filled up its cracks, floated off shore or burrowed underground. They were made of many shapes and ideas, but all had this in common: they stood where the Orders did not. The Free Republic of Ponmon was one of the more strident.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff’s voice created currents that threw up dust. When the echoes faded and the dust settled, Ouma Tau appeared. She had been tanning a yak hide so was covered in grime. The Sheriff had never seen a face so wrinkled.\r\n\r\n“In a man’s greeting lies his character,” said Ouma. “You are a shameless pig. A nuisance. You have upset the bees.”\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff touched his necklace. He spread his voice only a little further than his throat could project. “I would say the same about the greeting given to me by the people of Sonton. I saw no Banner to welcome me to your House.”\r\n\r\n“There is no Banner here. There is no House, just people.” said Ouma.\r\n\r\n“Those people have not answered my salutation, they have turned away from me,” said the Sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe old woman laughed as if she had heard something obvious.\r\n\r\n“The people cannot see a guest that is carrying Calamities!” she said, pointing a mocking finger at the Sheriff. “The chain around your throat, your armour, your bludgeon. Even your camel, I think!” she waved in the direction of the beast, who was still chewing her way through her feedbag. “Calamities, we can do without. There are calamities everywhere in the world, but not here. We have no Order so we have no Calamities. This keeps fortune on our side. Surrender yours, or leave.”\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff recognised the tone of authority.\r\n\r\n“You are the leader here?” he asked, his voice lowered a notch in respect.\r\n\r\n“I tan the hides, I split the hives, I spoil the children,” Ouma said, gazing abstractedly at the hills.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff spat. His patience was exhausted.\r\n\r\n“But you are lying,” he said, marching past the old woman. “You have the Worm.”\r\n\r\nShe thought about this for a moment.\r\n\r\n“The Worm is not a Calamity,” she called, and walked after him. He was surprised at how quickly she matched his pace. He was heading downhill towards the valley.\r\n\r\n“You don’t have the expertise to identify one. They can take many guises,” he snarled.\r\n\r\n“The Worm is not one,” she repeated. Their walk had gathered some attention. The Sheriff saw men appear at the tops of the cliffs. He measured the distances, turned up his voice, and spoke three words at each of them. The words ballooned inside their bodies. They doubled over with pain and fell, gasping, to their knees.\r\n\r\n“You are so frightened by my grandchildren that you’ve hurt them,” chuckled Ouma. “How great and powerful your magic is!” The Sheriff turned to her and spoke another word:\r\n\r\n“COMPLY.”\r\n\r\nOuma crumbled like a log burned through. She coughed and coughed. The Sheriff tried to explain himself.\r\n\r\n“I have seen the smoke of the Worm, I have heard its cries. You people claim to forsake the magic but every time you crawl back to it like a dog at the back door.” Ouma said nothing, the wind was gone from her. She shook her head, and even this somehow had a hectoring tone to the Sheriff.\r\n\r\n“Since you are now making use of magic, your land must respect the authority of the Order. Without our guidance, you will misuse it. People will be hurt, and killed. We have seen it happen again and again.\" He gathered himself. “Cover your ears, grandmother,” he said to her and then, to everyone:\r\n“THIS HOUSE IS UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE ORDER OF FURY. WE WILL SEND A BROTHER WITH A BANNER, AND WE WILL BUILD AN ABBEY FOR HIM. YOU WILL FEED HIM AND RESPECT HIS WISHES, FOR THEY ARE THE WISHES OF THE ORDER. ANY ACT AGAINST YOUR BROTHER WILL BE AN ACT AGAINST THE ORDER.”\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff’s hair settled again around his shoulders. His pulse was racing from the exertion. He had no doubt that the people of Sonton had heard his voice. Since they had heard it, they were now subject to the law. He helped Ouma Tau to her feet.\r\n\r\n“It will be for the best,” he said, with his plain voice. “Our Brother and our Banner will stand guard against others who would use the Relics to conquer you. You won’t have to be afraid of outsiders.”\r\n\r\n“You should be afraid of us,” said Ouma, her face a deep scowl. The Sheriff looked at the old woman, barely standing. He looked at her grandchildren that had tried to attack him, who were staggering off to hide again. He looked around at the frightened faces peering out from behind trees and yurts. He allowed the old woman her pride. He held her small brown hand in his.\r\n\r\n“Please show me the Worm,” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe led him towards the coast, into the valley. This is where he had seen the smoke rise. The mage from his office had heard the breathing come from within the mountain. He wondered how the people had caught the Worm and how they controlled it. In the valley was a well-worn path leading towards the entrance of a coal mine cut into the cliff face. The mines in Sonton provided coal for much of the Realm. The Republics were especially reliant on it as a source of heat and fuel. They walked on the path, overshadowed by the cliffs. The Sheriff could smell the sea air.\r\n\r\n“We’ve already had one,” muttered Ouma Tau.\r\n\r\n“What was that, grandmother?” asked the Sheriff. She had been quiet and pliant now that she knew what his voice could do. He had been easy on her - sometimes he had been forced to use it lethally. He could rupture lungs and make brains into jelly.\r\n\r\n“When I was a girl, we had a Brother. He lived just there, in a fine abbey. The tallest building for miles.” ” she pointed at an indistinguishable scrap of land. “When we decided we wanted no part in the Order, he went over the cliff, just there.” It was clear enough what she was pointing at then. The Sheriff gave a short, ugly laugh. There was much to doubt about the story, and he admired the old woman for her spirit. He knew what the repercussions would be for a House that killed its attendant Brother. Even one Advocate of the Order could lay this Realm to waste. The leaders would be culled with the cattle. The crops and the dwellings burned. He estimated that he could do all of that here, single-handedly, in an afternoon. He whistled as the entrance to the mine loomed closer. He could hear something coming from within.\r\n\r\n“That is the breathing of the Worm?” the Sheriff asked. Ouma Tau nodded. He activated his breastplate, which shone a bright beam ahead of him. He entered the mine and Ouma Tau lagged behind. The breathing was short and deep. The Sheriff had not heard anything quite like it.\r\n\r\nHis suspicions about the Worm were confirmed - it was a massive beast. Had it been made artificially large by a Relic, or was it a demon of an unknown nature? Had the people here captured it somehow, or were they in its thrall?\r\n\r\nHis spirit sang. He looked back at the entrance to the mine, where the frightened silhouettes of villagers swam. He was not afraid so he pressed on. His voice could tame any monster. The larger the foe, the more pressure he could exert on its innards. He adjusted his necklace to a suitable power for a stunning blow. The breathing was deafening.\r\n\r\nThe beam from his chestplate caught a moment of movement. A blurred set of pikes, attached to a whirling mass, chopping as if held by runners. The Sheriff had all of half a second to inspect the Worm before it hit him. His armour took the brunt of the impact but its beam was extinguished. The Sheriff was carried backwards by the blow and the Worm ran along with him. He discovered that he was being held by the sleeve of his coat. The sleeve tugged and then dragged him along with the Worm as it galloped towards the mine’s entrance. The incessant panting of its lungs filled his head. A rectangle of daylight ran towards him, and he calculated the unearthly speed at which the Worm was lunging out of its lair. He worked to free his sleeve and the Worm took hold of his hair in jealousy. It pulled with a leaden millstone grasp. The Sheriff found his footing along the floor of the mine and brought his knife up with his free hand. He tore back his sleeve and cut free his hair. The Worm ran ahead still clutching his hair in its claws. He ran behind it to slow his momentum and keep from falling. The Worm punched into the light and the Sheriff sprinted to catch it.\r\n\r\nHe had the span of a few footsteps to try and make sense of the Iron Worm’s nature. It was indeed made of iron, but the idea of it being a beast fell short. It had no head to speak of, and where he had expected to see the clattering legs of a centipede there were small wheels. It was segmented, but in the same way a series of wagons were hitched together. As he saw it speed into the distance he saw that the Iron Worm was trailing behind it many containers of coal.\r\n\r\nHe stood at the opening of the mine and adjusted his necklace. His confusion hardened to anger. A contraption for hauling coal had nearly taken his scalp. He would slay this beast that was never a beast with one almighty shout.\r\n\r\nTwo men in veils appeared at his left side and threw a heavy clay pipe at him. It glanced off his side and broke on the ground. The two men were already in a run when the Sheriff turned to them. Another pair, carrying another pipe, appeared at his right side. He saw the ambush and inhaled, ready to strike them both dead for this childishness.\r\n\r\nThe clay pipes were the housings of a beehive. The pipe that had broken at the Sheriff’s feet had released thousands of angry bees into the air. So when the Sheriff inhaled, a bee was sucked into the upper part of his trachea. The bee panicked and stung the inside of his throat. The Sheriff coughed, which sent a thunderclap into the cliffside and crushed the bee. He choked on the bee’s carcass as her sisters fell upon him with vengeance.\r\n\r\nOne of the veiled men who had thrown the pipe moved through the cloud of bees and removed the Sheriff’s necklace. The Sheriff was quite helpless and entering anaphylaxis. He was sure to hurt someone while coughing and spluttering with such a powerful voice. The necklace was taken to Ouma Tau, who was standing a safe distance away. When the Sheriff was dead and the bees had settled down they collected his body, along with his breastplate.

    "\r\nGenesis Scrolls Round 3: {The hunted did a-hunting go}\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nSep 2022\r\nSep 2022\r\n\r\nTicklish\r\nSep '22\r\nName/Pseudonym: {Ticklish}\r\nContact Info: {https://twitter.com/ticklishart}\r\nEthereum Wallet Address: {0xB1b3751834646fb999EDd18CA62C69663071cF43}\r\n\r\nAuthor’s note: This story takes place immediately after the events of None So Blind. 2 It also heavily references events and characters from Fallen Cavern. 1 Sayadaw’s long-term plans involve the events of Sow the Wind and begin to form in Fallen Necropolis.\r\n\r\nThe hunted did a hunting go\r\nThe first a thief who walked too slow\r\nShe stole a piece of the second one’s beau\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh\r\n\r\nKader’s head was pounding and her eyes were blurry but she was propelled forward by the force of her betrayal.\r\n\r\nShe had been a loyal warrior for the Order of Power since she was a young girl but then she had been injured in the line of duty and callously discarded. She hiked across the dull grey stone of Nuiknaauiena, under forest and shade wherever she could.\r\n\r\nWhen agents of the Order of Vitriol had asked her to snatch a treasure away from the Order of Power she had accepted without much resistance. Vitriol worshipped weakness, in its own fashion, the way that Power worshipped strength. Kader and her broken head belonged there now. And so she pressed on, dizzy and short of breath, with the stolen Sword on her Belt. She was to meet her new handler from the Scrollhouse of ën Umël in the forest ruins outside the Realm. They would take the Sword from her and so would let her remain as a warrior, and she would keep the Boots she had mastered and the Belt that had been in her family for generations.\r\n\r\nKader leaned underneath the swollen shelter of a fleece tree at the base of the Viper’s Peak. She scanned the sky for dangers - hunters blessed with flight, or a vegetative drone bound to the Judge of the Reliquary, but the day was clear and lovely. She needed to drink, for her injury was drawing a heavy thirst and her supplies were low, so she looked to the insects and the greenery to lead her to water.\r\n\r\nShe did not have the imagination to picture what her future would hold. She had upheld every instruction that the Order had given her since she had been enrolled at the prestigious Academy of Light in Mapkin. She had polished her armour with pride, vanquished enemies and traitors and recovered land and loot to swell the Order’s might. Before her last mission had gone wrong and she’d been struck by a rival warrior, she was on a resolute path to prefectship and then martial command over a Realm as a Lord. Now she was a lost thing, a vagrant, a courier between squabbling giants. The Order of Vitriol had given no firm assurances to her in exchange for the Sword, and she didn’t have to dig deep within herself to realise she didn’t deserve any.\r\n\r\nPresently she came to a river. It was cold as bliss so she wet a rag to tie around her aching head, removed her Boots, which gave her steps the magic to pass through solid things, and washed her swollen feet. As she wriggled the nubs of her toes in the stream she unclipped the silver cups from her Belt and filled them from the river. The cups could make any water they held fresh and drinkable. The Belt was the only memory she had of her House for it was engraved with its old name: Whisper.\r\n\r\nWith her head soothed, her feet relieved and her thirst quenched, Kader became dangerously close to becoming comfortable. Her eyes fell upon the little figure in the distance, some mountain-man scrabbling in the river for food from the bony oyster reef that pointed at intervals out from the mud. She almost dismissed the shape as being harmless before some part of her, a part that could never be comfortable, sounded the alarm and made her lie back, out of sight. Her hand was on the hilt of the fearsome Sword she had stolen from him.\r\n\r\nThe hunted did a-hunting go\r\nThe next a scrounge with guilt in tow,\r\nHe made a mess from his love and woe,\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh\r\n\r\nAvanesh had been walking in circles. His equipment, which included his compass, had been drowned in the cave he’d been prospecting. Drowned along with his clothes, his maps, and his husband.\r\n\r\nHe had escaped that horror with only his Gloves and a stub of his life. He had wormed his way through a narrow tunnel towards daylight while the cavern flooded below him. The love of his fairly short and mostly desperate life, Bahadur, had been unable to follow. Bahadur’s Crown had helped him find the tunnel to the surface but he couldn’t have fit through it himself and, well, he was in a bad state when Avanesh last saw him. So Avanesh had pressed on through the daylight, naked in the brisk autumn air, with grief snapping at his heels.\r\n\r\nHis Gloves were made from the hide of a demon, one that presumably had the acumen of an engineer imprinted in its flesh, for the Gloves gave Avanesh an uncanny sense of creation. When he held something in his hand, the Gloves gave him a sense of how it could be shaped and incorporated into a craft. The Gloves completed the link in Avanesh’s mind between material and potential.\r\n\r\nAnd so after his escape from the murderous cave, he stitched together leaves with caterpillar silk to make a rainjacket. He filtered water through charcoal and knapped flint to make blades for all occasions. He hiked cross-country to find the path home but the Gloves could not tell him which way to go. One night as he prepared a fire to cook the grubs he had dug from a mound, he searched around in the evening’s light for a dull flint to make a spark and briefly handled a flat grey rock. On contact with that rock the Gloves flared in his mind, telling him how the rock could be shattered into needles, and how those needles would point towards the North when floated on water.\r\n\r\nThat morning he descended to the river with a flake of magnetite, cupped some water in his hand and let the unseen forces of the world point him towards home. His other hand trailed in the river’s stream, and some tiny part of his mind observed that there was revenge in the water. He glanced upstream just in time to see a seated woman watching him. She ducked down too late to avoid his sight. He picked up a fist of stone from the river and his Gloves told him it was harder than a skull.\r\n\r\nThe hunted did a hunting go\r\nThe last one here, the virtuoso,\r\nHer bloody plans nearing crescendo\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh\r\n\r\nSayadaw saw the devastation from the air. The Crown she wore was quite unnecessary for finding her quarry when the entire fleece forest of Haukpiukpipi pointed it out like a vast hound made of flames. A crater at the edge of the forest told her that the Sword had been unsheathed.\r\n\r\nShe had spent the last of her goodwill with the Order of Vitriol on the commandeering of a child-taker eagle from the Tiergarten of Kezkiisch. The bird was one half of the only breeding pair of its species that the Order possessed, the largest of its genus and the most effective means to catch Kader that Sayadaw had access to.\r\n\r\nSayadaw dangled in a harness bound to the child-taker’s talons and steered her by the emenations of her Amulet. The eagle had swallowed the distance between the soot-covered rooftops of Spezlaas and the austere mountains of Nuiknaauiena with little trouble. The Crown she had taken such pains to fish from the fallen cavern guided her flight straight towards the Sword that Kader had and everybody wanted. If Kader succeeded in delivering it to her new masters in the Order of Vitriol, Sayadaw’s masters in the Order of Power would upend the world to wrestle it back. The destruction that had already touched Haukpiukpipi would bring adventurers from every Order to the scene and Sayadaw, who had more imagination than most, could not predict an outcome to this that did not lead to a full-blown interordinal war.\r\n\r\nThe Crown rang in her ears without sound and she rapped on her Amulet to bring the eagle down. In the fading twilight she saw a pit among the smouldering trees. She unfastened the straps that held her in the talons and landed on the soil without much grace. Her mount was unsettled by the smoke and the fire but she kept it planted to the ground by dampening its senses.\r\n\r\nThe pit had been dug roughly but functioned well as a trap for a person. Sayadaw crouched at its edge and saw the shivering form of Kader sat at its bottom. The Crown had already notified her that the Sword was not in there with her but Sayadaw, raised in the ways of Vitriol, could not avoid her duty to admonish and correct her former lieutenant.\r\n“A good thief has cunning, resolve, and a certain knack for not falling into holes. Oh, and I see you’ve lost your Boots too,” she said.\r\n\r\nKader got to her feet, her head rising to a level just below Sayadaw’s bandaged feet. The history of inversions of their respective positions played over her face. Kader had been brought up in the Realms of Power and had defected to the Order of Vitriol. Sayadaw had been born in the Realms of Vitriol and had been recruited into the Order of Power. Now the two of them had been disgraced in the eyes of both organisations. These twists were too strange for Kader to keep in focus, so she stuck to the facts of the matter.\r\n“The warrior, Avanesh Tipanis Angle, ambushed me while I bathed. He manoeuvred me towards a defensive trench he had dug beforehand,” she said, preferring to pretend for the moment that Sayadaw was still her commanding officer.\r\n“He ambushed you while you were carrying the weapon that can end wars,” observed Sayadaw, letting the statement hang as she feigned a loss of interest. Kader straightened her face. Her nostrils flared and her jaw tightened.\r\n“I wasn’t trained in the operation of the Sword,” she said, and began to weep. Sayadaw hated that. She hadn’t ever got used to the emotional incontinence that the Order of Power encouraged its adherents to practice. She rose to her feet and tried to ignore Kader and instead focus on the Crown she wore. She was no expert in its use but it had led her to Kader. She fumbled through her mind to present the Crown an image of Avanesh it could use. Slowly a sensation of his location formed around her ears. She rotated her body to try and home in on the sensation, peering through the blackened trees and the mounting smoke, and then saw him creeping towards her. She lost one precious instant in resolving the confusion between her own senses and those of the Crown but used the next to leap out of the way as Avanesh hurled one of Kader’s Boots at her.\r\n\r\nThe Boot was loaded with stones, which spilled out of its throat as it flew. It passed through the child-taker eagle that Sayadaw had used as a mount, trailing stones as it went. The momentum of the stones made a hideous stew of the eagle’s innards. The eagle spent its final, bewildered moments alive lunging and flapping at Avanesh, which saved Sayadaw’s life from being taken in the same manner. He dropped the second Boot, which sank partway into the soil, and brandished a short flint spear he had made. He pierced the eagle’s neck and retracted the spear in a singular smooth motion. As the massive bird crumpled to the ashen floor, Sayadaw’s hand went to her Amulet, her fingers already passingly familiar with the shape of Avanesh’s nerves thanks to the brief altercation that they had shared in the cave. Avanesh threw the spear at Sayadaw and the razor-sharp flint sailed through her linen robe and the meat of her thigh.\r\n\r\nFrom her prison in the dirt, Kader made a yelp of pleading to Avanesh. He gave her a look of disdain and unsheathed Bahadur’s Sword. This time it did not set a forest alight. He aimed the tip at Sayadaw and spoke the first words he had ever directed at her, though she had presented many to him when he was trapped inside the fallen cavern.\r\n“I only want the Crown. Give it to me and I will release you.”\r\n\r\nSayadaw’s finger hovered over the surface of her Amulet. She could interrupt the signals that travelled up and down Avanesh’s body very quickly, but he had tasted this trick before and might be able to resist an assault long enough to strike back. She also did not know how exactly the Sword worked and what it could do to her at this distance. But she did know that Avanesh’s Gloves would give him a good idea of how best to use it.\r\n\r\n“It belonged to my husband, as did this Sword,” said Avanesh. His fine Gloves looked bright and incongruous against the layer of mud he wore as camouflage underneath the strange coat of leaves. Sayadaw was surprised by this forthcoming elaboration. She supposed that Avanesh had never negotiated from a winning position before. The flow of blood from her leg was making her robes heavy.\r\n“What will you do with it?” asked Sayadaw. It worked as a distraction because she was genuinely interested and Avanesh had not spoken to anyone for days.\r\n“I will take them to his family in Susuko,” he said grandly. Sayadaw felt a silent tone around her forehead. The Crown dutifully pointed out the direction to Susuko to her - a muffled shrug towards the southwest, far over the Vibrian Waters.\r\n“Why?” asked Sayadaw as she shifted her weight over to her good leg.\r\n“They should pass to his sister, who was the next eldest,” said Avanesh to Sayadaw as if she were simple. She held up her hand to signal acceptance. She unwound the Crown from her head and flung it halfway to Avanesh. It settled near the body of the dead eagle. Sayadaw clasped her wound to staunch the blood.\r\n\r\nThe fires drew closer as Avanesh trod carefully towards Sayadaw. She watched him with one eye. She had gambled her life’s work to win that Crown. She would be ejected with disgrace from the Order of Power and the Order of Vitriol would not welcome her back with open arms. All of her plans had been broken from the moment that Bahadur had drawn that wretched sword on them down in the dark. She had used up all of her resources to mend them.\r\n\r\nThere was something half-tempting about this outcome, as bitter as it was, because the Sword, at least, would be out of reach, as would be the means to find it. If Bahadur’s family had kept it hidden for centuries, it was likely they could manage a century or two more. Without their prize to fight over, the Orders of the Realms would fall back into their usual habits of hoarding relics. Avanesh moved around the eagle and, with the Sword still raised at Sayadaw, bent to pick up the Crown. Their eyes locked as Sayadaw held her thigh in both hands.\r\nShe saw something in his eyes, then said, “It’s a long way to travel, to reach Susuko,” Avanesh, who had been lost ever since he abandoned Bahadur in the cave, considered this. Slowly, with one hand, he folded the Crown and tied it around his head.\r\n“Bahadur’s memory will guide me,” he said with satisfaction. Sayadaw struck with a cobra’s speed.\r\n“Where did you leave his body to rot?” she asked. Avanesh’s face ran through disbelief to anger but stumbled over the Crown’s insistence on telling him exactly where Bahadur lay - in that miserable sunken cave where Avanesh had bludgeoned him in a desperate bid to save his own hide. Trapped in the cavern of his flooding mind, the Crown showed him Bahadur’s face, just as he’d seen him last. He was, for that wrenching moment, vividly, impossibly alive.\r\n\r\nSayadaw had the open luxury of a moment to bring her hand to her Amulet. Through it, she reached out and tugged on the nerve that connected Avanesh’s spine to his heart. Avanesh lurched, and slurred something that might have been a name as his arms drooped and the Sword fell from his hands. His vision danced with images of Bahadur as he staggered forwards in no particular direction. His brain filled up with bloody foam and he tripped over the remains of the eagle. He did not rise again.\r\n\r\nA smouldering fleece tree fell with a crash nearby. Viper’s Peak would not permit its visitors to stay for much longer. Sayadaw bit down on the disgust she felt whenever she killed someone and limped over to her fading opponent. He paid her no attention. He was too busy with dying and his eyes were fixed on something only he could see; his mouth half curving into an incredulous smile. She removed his Gloves and Crown as the light left him and wore them herself, having no where else to put them. She picked up Kader’s Boots and she took the Sword that had caused everyone so much trouble. The Gloves told her some garbled things about metal that she worked hard to ignore. Kader was saying something so she went over to her trench and realised that there was no good reason to leave her there. She offered her hand and Kader took it. When they touched, Sayadaw was overwhelmed by the signal from the Gloves. Among the noise she realised just how badly Kader had been injured, and how much had been taken from her. With a certain indignation on Kader’s behalf she dragged her from the pit. They held each other up and painfully made their escape.\r\n\r\nThey were both traitors, and so they were both hunted. The sharing of this fostered a comradery that neither of them had known before. With all the world their enemy, Sayadaw let Kader into her private world of ambition. With the Crown they had the means to find the pieces of something incredible. With the Boots they could retrieve those pieces from the deepest hiding place. With the Gloves they could put the pieces back together. Once repaired, they could communicate with the entity with the Amulet. Doing this would completely change the world. And with the Sword, no one could stop them.\r\n\r\n–\r\n\r\nJacky boy\r\n- Master\r\nSing me well\r\n- Very well\r\n\r\nHey, down, ho, down, very very down\r\nAmong the leaves so green, oh",
    "\r\nA guide to the Sayadaw Cycle\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nOct 2022\r\nOct 2022\r\n\r\nTicklish\r\n\r\n2\r\nOct '22\r\nTo the readers and the curators, I present to you seven stories that begin as standalone character pieces and quickly become entwined with a fairly complex narrative. I speak of:\r\n\r\n1. Fallen Cavern 6\r\n2. None So Blind 5\r\n3. The Colours of Light 4\r\n4. Sow the Wind 5\r\n5. Fallen Necropolis 3\r\n6. The hunted did a-hunting go 3\r\n7. Reap the Whirlwind 3\r\n\r\nTogether they tell of the life and unlikely rise to infamy of the mage, Spezlaasin Thint Sayadaw.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the order in which they were published is the intended reading order, but this may prove to be an unpopular suggestion. I will straighten the slinky for us all by laying out the events of the stories in chronological order:\r\n\r\nSow the Wind 5 - at some point in the Oligocene, a demon cruiseliner crashes on Earth. It scatters many objects and Loot bags across its surface which will be discovered later by the characters. Its Captain goes down with the Ship. (My two other stories, ‘Brother, You Are Not Welcome,’ and ‘The Other Shoe,’ as well as Banners’ story ‘The Stranger and the Three Fires,’ follow the path of an item that was part of the Ship’s public announcement system.)\r\nThe Colours of Light 4 - much later, Sayadaw is born in the Realm of Spezlaas. As an infant, she learns how to use a magical Ring to see electromagnetic interactions. This Ring was once part of a set of opera glasses for the passengers of the Ship to view the effects that solar flares made on the Earth’s magnetosphere along their journey. Sayadaw is bright and is schooled in a nunnery controlled by the Order of Vitriol. She is taken in by a research assistant, Ozige, who gives her an Amulet. The Amulet was once the communications interface between the Ship and its Captain, but humans only know how to use it as a scarecrow to startle birds. Thanks to Sayadaw’s mastery of the Ring, she can use it to interrupt and sometimes control the nervous systems of other living things. She graduates from her school and is head-hunted by a Wanderer, Odavwaro, from the Order of Power. She leaves with him to further her education among the grand Academies of Light.\r\nFallen Necropolis 3 - some time into the journey from Spezlaas in the far North to the Realm of Hahhukhin, Sayadaw and Odavwaro pass through the Fallen Necropolis near Sukumo. There they discover the Captain, buried in the Loot bag that was the bridge of the Ship. This is retroactively written to be the same location as ‘Something More Than Loot Itself,’ and Tayv’s sinister tree-throne is said to be the backside of the Captain, a feeding apparatus they had built during their long sleep under the ground. Sayadaw uses her Amulet to try and talk to the Captain but she is not built to receive their messages. Together, she and Odavwaro improvise a way for some limited communication, which opens Sayadaw’s mind to possibilities. Odavwaro decides to keep the entire episode to himself and ‘gifts’ the buried bag to Sayadaw, though they do not have the resources to excavate it then and there.\r\nReap the Whirlwind (1) 3 - However, after years of training and work for the Order of Power as a Procurer, Sayadaw has the knowledge and the means to dig that Loot bag out of the ground. She interrogates the Captain and is told the strange tale of a Ship that breaks apart, leaving shipwrecked demons, Loot items and bags scattered across the Earth. The Captain begs for her to rebuild the Ship so they may go home. She stashes the bag containing the Captain with Ozige in Spezlaas and decides to investigate this story. Ozige warns her of the dire consequences that could arise from this.\r\nFallen Cavern 6 - after some time, Sayadaw discovers two key Loot items that would be perfect for someone who might want to find all of the parts of a ruined Ship and then put them back together - a Crown for finding things and a pair of Gloves for crafting things. Both items are in the possession of a couple of treasure-hunters, and Sayadaw recruits a warrior of Power, Kader, to help her recover them. She badly batches the job and the wearer of the Gloves, Avanesh, escapes after injuring Kader.\r\nNone So Blind 5 - Following the events of Fallen Cavern, Sayadaw is admonished by her superiors and Kader is fired from the Order. Sayadaw goes alone to retrieve the Crown from the fallen cavern, telling her boss, The Judge of the Reliquary, that she will recover a powerful Sword that the treasure-hunters incongruously were carrying. She gets the Crown, but Kader has been recruited by the Order of Vitriol and steals the Sword from under her nose. This causes Sayadaw to also be fired from the Order of Power.\r\nThe hunted did a-hunting go 3 - Immediately after this, Kader runs into Avanesh in the wilderness near Viper’s Peak and is caught in a trap. Sayadaw rushes in with the help of an eagle mount and cleans up the considerable mess she has made. Avanesh is killed, his Gloves taken, and the Sword is recovered. Kader and Sayadaw join forces as fugitives.\r\nReap the Whirlwind (2) - With the aid of the Gloves and the Crown, Sayadaw speaks again to the Captain and, with nothing left to lose, formulates a plan to rebuild the Ship. Sayadaw, Kader, Ozige and the Captain hunt down several caches of Loot bags, including the one mentioned in ‘A Cruel Fate,’ raid the Reliquary of Power, and Sayadaw lashes together a partial reconstruction of the lost Ship. On this flying fortress they found the Order of Cataclysm. That can’t be good!\r\nMay this chronological order smooth over any cracks that may arise in the reading experience.\r\n\r\nYour pal,\r\nTicklish",
    "\r\nHoly War Lore | Chapter 2 drafts proposal\r\nWriting\r\nSep 2021\r\nJan 2022\r\n\r\nWMPeaster\r\nSep '21\r\nI crafted this Holy War Lore Ch. 2 draft proposal in building off the narrative and themes put forth in Chapter 1, which has already been put up for a vote on Snapshot 28. This Ch. 2 proposal offers tentative follow-ups for both the “Destroy the Crown” and “Put on the Crown” lore options possible in the Ch. 1 vote. What do you think?\r\n\r\nIf “Destroy the Crown” selected by Loot community, then:\r\n\r\n“I mustn’t,” the enrobed man said.\r\n\r\nWasting no time the hero then gathered the finest spellcasters the mortal realm could spare amid the worsening Great Holy War, and with a terrific midnight ritual returned the captured demon crown to nothingness. Yet hundreds of darkly crowns remained, and the Demon King’s brutal forces were currently making deep advances into the realm’s Outer Districts. Seeded by the enemy’s spies, panic and whispers of defeat began to spread through the ranks of the good-hearted.\r\n\r\nDoom was nigh, but not assured yet. Facing the beginnings of an all-out rout and an age of unimaginable darkness, the divinely-clad hero and other great leaders of the Free World convened an emergency council in the Capital Zone. The gathered captains and sages debated the mortal’s war plan for a half a fortnight; all agreed that field commanders should tactically target demon-crown holders as force multipliers, but what of the war’s greater strategy?\r\n\r\nToward that question two factions quickly broke out. The first faction rallied around calling back all available mortal forces to the Capital Zone, which was vastly more defensible than the Outer and Middle Districts and could reasonably support many refugees for an extended period of time. The second camp argued that the Demon King’s forces should be delayed in the Outer Districts for as long as possible while a small adventurer party was sent to consort with the last living and extremely reclusive Blue Oracle for guidance.\r\n\r\nAt points the discussions became so heated that fighting almost broke out among the heroes, their hearts all in the right yet their minds at odds. With no overwhelming consensus in sight, the mortals decided to discreetly elect via colored pebbles one from among themselves to make the final call. In this way, the Man in the Divine Robe was chosen to lead.\r\n\r\nHe learned of this election and in that moment the man felt like all the gods and all mankind were watching what his lips would do next.\r\n\r\n“Should we retreat to the Capital,” he thought, “Or does the Blue Oracle know that path to save the World?”",

Dawn had not yet broken, but a pale light was rising to lap at the brink of morning, and the stars were fading one by one. A single magpie could be seen in the blanching sky. Against the grey half-light, the black and white feathers seem incongruously vibrant. The bird seemed to tear a path through the paper of the sky, leaving fleeting, wing-shaped impressions of something on the other side that was by turns pure black, pure white.\r\n\r\nThis island was ceaseless and horizonless; devoid of hills or mountains. One could travel across its entire breadth and length without walking up or down any sort of incline whatsoever, which was why travellers called it the flatlands, or by its ancient name, The Levelle. The oldest stories about The Levelle spoke of a great demon who rolled the land out flat with his rolling pin and baked bread upon it, the crumbs of which became the first stars. These sorts of antique stories were not well remembered any more by the peoples of this land, and many had been forgotten entirely, along with the ancient songs, although the demons and wildfolk still knew them by heart.\r\n\r\nIn these days, the rulers of the Order of Protection placed a great deal of emphasis on peace and stability, and therefore the people of the Order of Protection did too. They worshipped the God Mooth, the great orator, and considered themselves to be accordingly blessed in the gifts of speech and diplomacy. By the year of Our Lady Antzuma, the Levelle was a nation of stability, well esteemed for its skills in peacekeeping and reconciliation, with ambassadors and advisors well established in almost all corners of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the fourth day of winter finally broke, the morning light spilled out from its bowl in the sky and eventually touched a wild corner of the island, far from the royal castle, where the young crown prince Leif Berraneka was journeying. His hair, when the light touched it, was as pale as boneflower; his eyes reflected perfectly the grey weight of the dawn sky and seemed to hold no colour of their own at all. They were bright with that peculiar, luminous quality that is often seen in the eyes of sleepwalkers or people who are not quite well – pensive and dreaming by turns, gazing at nothing and everything. Now his face was quite calm and composed, although his eyes glimmered with the unsteady quality of starlight.\r\n\r\nAlthough his complexion and bearing were princely in the highest degree, his dress was somewhat peculiar. He wore the garb of a hunter, though rather badly. His plain hide armour had an enchantment on it that had either been diluted to start with or had faded with age: it glowed queasily in the gloom with its own faint, greenish light. It seemed too large for his slim frame, and as he stood to stretch and gather up his bedroll it was evident that he was clumsy beneath the weight of the chainmail, and moved awkwardly with it. His boots and gloves were dogskin, and at his side hung an unadorned silver sword with the symbol of the Order of Protection at the pommel. Then, alongside these unremarkable – some might even say unprincely - articles of equipment, he wore an ostentatious filigree crown worked delicately out of real lumin, and dripping with diamonds. The prince’s initials, LB, had been picked out in opals at the front, so there could really be no question of his identity, even though a glance at his features was sufficient to mark him out as a son of Queen Berranek. This crown sat like a beacon on the young prince’s head, glittering his family connections out into the world for all to see. Inexplicably, it held no powers or enchantments whatsoever - neither could it be of any use as an actual helmet, being as delicate and light as a sugar decoration on a wedding cake.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly a strange state of affairs, given the dangers of the wild territory that the Prince found himself in, which was home to more demons than humans, and was far from the protection of the castle. It was difficult to fathom but Prince Leif himself appeared unperturbed, and stood gazing westwards with a mild, thoughtful expression towards Wuulwemul as the sun rose.\r\n\r\nHe was not far now from the Mirror Grotto - the lair of the demon Rojin and the great store of treasure that it hoarded there. Among the riches, fiercely guarded, were rumoured to be a number of Divine Relics – the name given in that land to items bestowed with rare and mysterious power. The Prince himself, it should be mentioned, was in possession of one such Divine Relic, which had been bequeathed to him by the Queen Antova on the day he came of age. It was an Amulet of Protection; a golden locket in the shape of two cupped hands hanging on a golden chain around Leif’s neck. This amulet, contrary to its name, did not afford the young Prince any form of protection at all, but was blessed with the curious trick of being able to magic into existence an endless supply of seeds of the royal tree of the Order of Protection. The existence of this Divine Relic and its possession by the royal family of the Order of Protection perhaps explained the family’s ancient pledge to shade the land and feed the people, which the holding of this relic neatly fulfilled. Prince Leif unclasped the locket now, and although the amulet would not have rattled had it been shaken, a small reddish brown nut now sat in the hollow of the golden hands. He lifted it to his lips, kissed it, and stooped to plant it in the soil at his feet.\r\n\r\nRoyal pledge fulfilled, the Prince straightened to gather his knapsack, and saw the magpie. It was perched on a low branch of a nearby lanya tree, and although it had been assiduously wiping its beak on a cluster of leaves before, it now stopped as if embarrassed, and, turning its head aside, looked narrowly at the Prince with one bright berry-black eye.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, master magpie!” said Leif, mostly to himself. It was considered good luck on the island to greet a magpie when you saw one – this was an old folk tradition, the origins of which had been lost to time.\r\n\r\nThe magpie ignored him. It was looking at his crown now. It turned its head to the other side in order to assess the sparkling edifice more properly with its right eye, and then cocked its head again to inspect it with the left. It craned its neck to get a better view. It leaned forward on its branch and stared, its beak slightly open and its eyes bright with diamonds, until Leif broke out laughing.\r\n\r\nThis startled the bird briefly into flight – its wingbeat, stammering, tattooed the air between them with bands of black and white which resolved when the bird landed in the velvet shade of the lanya tree’s upper branches.\r\n\r\n“Sorry,” Leif said, half laughing. “Aren’t you beautiful! What would you like?”\r\n\r\nThe magpie peered down at him.\r\n\r\n“Would you like something to eat? Here, have this! And keep me from bad luck, won’t you?” Smiling, he took a second nut from the little golden amulet and tossed it to the ground beneath the tree.\r\n\r\nThe sun was high enough now to travel by; he would easily reach the Grotto by evening. There was treasure to be retrieved and a powerful guardian to be reckoned with - and if the demon Rojin was as fierce as the stories suggested then Leif would need all the good luck he could get. If the thought of this coming battle troubled him at all, it did not show. The young Crown Prince, as he wandered westwards, could be heard singing a hymn under his breath – his eyes were the colour of the wide sky, his expression mild and far-off, as if he were remembering a place from his childhood as he sang.\r\n\r\nVeil thee with many veils,\r\n\r\nIt hideth not your fire\r\n\r\nBut rouseth thee to bright desire\r\n\r\nTo speak thy sacred tales.\r\n\r\nA faint clapping of wings could be heard. Back at the lanya tree, the magpie flew to the ground in a zoetropic stutter of black and white, and somewhere between the sky and the earth it found a new shape and became something else. The pale sun continued to rise; the air was quite still and cold. In the deep shade at the foot of the tree stood now the demon Rojin, dressed in a cloak of black and white feathers. They stooped briefly, and when they rose they held between their thumb and forefinger a nut of the royal tree of the Order of Protection. They held it up to their black eyes and examined it closely. They looked at the retreating shape of the Prince in the distance, and smiled hungrily, showing all of their teeth.}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

The bag reportedly contained a range of “magical items”, including a Robe, that Laklo frothily described as “rare” and “Divine”, gloves, presumably made of dragonskin, a ring, made of Titanium, which Laklo characterized as “absolutely perfect”, and a wand made of what appears to be bones of canine origin, such as a wolf or a fox, though Laklo inexplicably insists on it being “clearly of the Fox”. The bag contained some other items which this report will not bother to expand on, as we shall find that the nature of the items is anything but what Laklo claims they are, and we have a more parsimonious explanation for the bizarre series of events that did indeed seem to occur on that day.\r\n\r\nRobe: This report does not deny the existence of so-called “magical robes”, even though the vast majority of them are nothing more than expensive and ostentatious clothing. This is not the case with the Robe in question, which is in fact a genuine article of magical power. It is not, however, a particularly powerful item, and its effects are mostly limited to making the wearer look more attractive and commanding.\r\n\r\nGloves: These are, as Laklo correctly surmised, made of dragonskin, and are thus quite valuable. They are not, however, magical, and their only purpose is to protect the hands of the wearer from cold weather.\r\n\r\nRing: This is indeed a titanium ring, yet we do not share the assessment of “perfection”, given the limited epistemological meaningfulness of such an assessment.\r\n\r\nAs for the events that followed Laklo’s discovery, we will first attempt to summarize these from a purely perceptual point of view, in other words, as it must have appeared to the rather simple minds of the witnesses on that day.\r\n\r\nUpon opening the bag, Laklo first took out the ring and put it on his finger. He then proceeded to put the Robe on, and take out the bone wand, at which point he said some words in a language that no one present could understand. Laklo then appeared to have started to emanate a sort of glow, and his eyes turned “orange”. He then levitated off the ground and started to float around the area of the pond.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of those who witnessed these events, it would have appeared as if Laklo had indeed discovered a bag of magical items, and that these items had imbued him with magical powers.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must remember that Laklo is a known pathological liar, and that he has been known to invent stories in order to garner attention. In light of this, it is more likely that Laklo simply put on a show, using mundane items to create the illusion of magical powers.\r\n\r\nThe most likely explanation for the glowing and levitation is that Laklo used some kind of light source, such as a lantern, to create the illusion of magical powers. As for the orange eyes, this is most likely due to Laklo wearing paint on his eyelids.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth noting that Laklo’s story changes depending on who he is speaking to. For example, he told the farmers that the Robe made him feel “divine and special\", as if he \"had been granted special access to commune with others of similar standing”, yet he told the Elders that the Robe made him feel “as if I could fly”. It is clear that Laklo is simply making up stories as he goes along, and that he is not to be believed.\r\n\r\nFurther, Laklo has no magical experience or credentials whatsoever, and is not registered with any known guild of sorcery within the Realm, so even if he had indeed found a bag of magical items, it is inconceivable that he would have any idea how to use them.\r\n\r\nWe should also not make the mistake of not carefully examining the merit of our witnesses, as they are, for the most part, farmers with little to no education, and whose testimony must thus be taken with a grain of salt. For example, the shepherd Röplin Hlarbert, when questioned by Master Flololömen on the very evening of the day of the event, was unaware of the role of The Archive’s Elders, and mistook Master Flololömen for a “scribe or a monk\". His wife, Lïsbren Hlarbert, even called Master Flololömen a “moronic codger” when he found her to be completely unable to bring her outrageous testimony in line with the Third Ontic Principle. Their boy, Fërdin Hlarbert, was the only one of the three who seemed to be telling the truth with respect to a complete absence of magic in the matter, though his testimony is nevertheless too confused to be of investigative value, claiming that Laklo’s “floating around” did indeed not involve anything magical, as he was “simply flying like birds do, which have no magic to them either”.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is the opinion of this report that the events of Middleday the Fifteenth, as related by Hrënd Laklo and witnesses, are to be considered apocryphal, and that the items in question are nothing more than mostly mundane objects with negligible magical powers. This report therefore recommends that no further public investigation be made into the matter of the event itself, and the items be kept in the Archive’s vault to avoid any further mischaracterization of their nature.\r\n\r\nLastly, and unfortunately, it must be noted that some items seem to have been stolen or lost in the aftermath of the investigation. Specifically, the bone wand, the robe and the ring seem to have gone missing sometime between the original event and the subsequent delivery of the entire bag to the Archive by Master Flololömen. It is our opinion that they were clearly stolen by one of the witnesses or even Hrënd Laklo himself, which is further corroborated by the fact that Laklo seems to have gone missing himself after his interrogation. We recommend that a search be made for Hrënd Laklo and the missing items, and that he be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law if found guilty of theft.\r\n}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

As the loot items gain experience, this spirit grows in power. The spirits are currently immature, so their influence on the items’ abilities and adventurers is inconsequential, but the spirits are rapidly growing in power.\r\n\r\nAdventurers that wield eight items of the same mana spirit will be more effective in combat but risk having their sovereignty overpowered by the will of the mana spirit.\r\n\r\nMore time is needed to understand the specific nature and will of the 16 mana spirits, but for now, we strongly advise all adventurers to wield a mixture of items, with at most two items of the same spirit.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Cognoscenti Mana Spirit Identification Guide for instructions on determining the mana spirit infused in each of your items.\r\n\r\n===========================================================================",

Ping, a lesser god, living a lesser life in the lesser town of Amosen, went about his day doing what many lesser gods would do, nothing.\r\n\r\nIt should have been obvious when the loons arrived, and their ominous wail rang out across the land. The gods of Amosen paid little mind to the calls of the birds, and continued innocently through their days, unaware that dusk had finally arrived. A single orb opened in the center of town, and through it stepped the First God of War. Soon the orbs would cover all the land, and legions of war-hungry gods would rattle out their own battle cry and the loons would be heard no more.\r\n\r\nBut, let us not get ahead of ourselves. As the First God of War’s boot hit the ground, a smile, wide and full of teeth, stretched across his face. The First God laughed.\r\n\r\n“You there, what is your name?” A question full of mirth echoed loud across Amosen.\r\n\r\n“My name is Ping.”\r\n\r\n“Ping.” The First God rolled the name around in his mouth, “yes, well, Ping, today is your lucky day. This shithole you call a town is going to become a town of legend. Songs will be sung, banners will be made, and stories will be retold for all of time. You are so very lucky!”\r\n\r\nPing did not feel lucky… the entire town of Amosen didn’t feel lucky. In fact, the complete opposite of luck was the shared feeling that day. But, as with all things, the strong come, and the strong control, and the strong change everything.\r\n\r\nAll of the gods have power, from lowliest to the mightiest, and those powers which laid dormant in Amosen for so very long would once again awaken.\r\n\r\n“Ping, please, come here,” the First God ordered. “I’m told you’re very clever at the molding of metals.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, tis true, but no more than all us fellows of the forge. Our weapons seem to meet the approval of all their wielders,” Ping said as he took off his worn gloves and met the eyes of the First.\r\n\r\n“Oh, so modest, little Ping. But no, I hear you are different. You might just be capable of this task.” The First pulled out a strange metal from his satchel, and handed it over to Ping. “I need you, Ping, to make me a crown.”\r\n\r\n“What is this? This is not, it can’t be… Where did you find this?” Ping’s voice quivered out the questions.\r\n\r\n“Ah Ping, so many questions. The Day of Fire is coming soon, and I will be there to greet it, with your magnificent creation upon my head.”\r\n\r\nAs Ping stared down at the strange metal, he could feel the pull…the drawing in of himself. The metal was hungry for him.\r\n\r\nPing burst into the forge, short of breath as he croaked out in a voice the others had not heard before, “Women and men of the forge, come forward. I need all of our strength. Today we strike the void, and bend all of time to our will.”\r\n\r\nIn the heat and glow of the forge the mallets slammed while the gods sang. For 3 days they labored, until it was time for Ping to whisper his magic words and bind his will forever to the crown. The stone was set.\r\n\r\nPing carried the crown as the fellows of the forge followed, and as he lifted the crown toward the First God, he hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Ping, look at you, and look at this magnificent creation.” The First reached out and firmly pulled the crown from Ping’s grasp. All the gods watched as the crown was lifted. “It is perfect.” The First stared down at Ping\r\n\r\n“I must hold it again, please,” Ping said softly as tears fell down his face.\r\n\r\n“My poor child. Your task is now complete, and your story is now over” With unnatural speed the First God of War removed Ping’s head from his body. Tossing it aside he walked out of the town to meet the Day of Fire.\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed many gods would fall and the land would burn. Those that would live to tell the tales would sing and talk of a god on fire and a crown so bright it burned.\r\n}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

Those two realms bordered each other at Saltbane Point, a hazard-laden stretch of water that had claimed skilled maritimers who sailed too close. That account had come from a chatty barmaid at the Long Shot tavern in bek-Rim. bek-Rim was set inland at the end of a long inlet and looked like a quaint little fishing town, though its banner had two weapons. Lohmen recorded the house of Trident Catapult Morning Star on a green field with black trim into his tome. As the barmaid told it, large timbers from the surrounding forests were worked and formed to make the namesake war machines that were sought by armies from all over the continent. A quaint little fishing town with a booming industry of destruction nestled within. The sage snapper Lohmen ordered didn’t last as long as the oral history from the barmaid, but Lohmen found the story captivating. With a full belly and a new tale to think about on his travels, Lohmen left and was back to illumination.\r\n\r\n<> <> <>\r\n\r\nIt must be close. She said it was in the valley around here.\r\n\r\nLohmen trotted along the dusty trail and a town of sorts came out of hiding behind a ridge. Just like the barmaid in bek-Rim had promised, Kisilimli wasn’t so much a town, but more of a campsite. The inland village was a stunningly broad collection of yurts only appreciated fully by soaring birds. His subject, the Banner of Fire Horse Fire, waved at him from a thick standard driven into the ground. Were it not for that, this place wouldn’t have had a definitive entrance at all.\r\n\r\n“Hello!” said a happy child, around nine or ten years old, as he approached Lohmen.\r\n\r\n“Hello. I believe I’ve arrived at the House of Fire Horse Fire. Is that correct?”\r\n\r\n“Yes! Though we name ourselves Horse Two-Fires.” The young boy inspected Lohmen, his horse, and his bags as they exchanged pleasantries.\r\n\r\n“This is an ancient house, right?” Lohmen recalled reading about the ancient banners as a child. Any house bearing only animals and items of the earth were the oldest houses, some with history dating back thousands of years.\r\n\r\n“Yesser, here since the strangers. And long before the mythical or weapon houses.” He made a disapproving look as he mentioned the more modern banners.\r\n\r\nLohmen recognized that look. Kahriah had the same disdain for the houses of the sixteen orders. He started, “My wi–”\r\n\r\n“Is she with you, too?” The question came before Lohmen could finish. The childlike innocence cut through him like a dagger.\r\n\r\n“Just me today. But say, I’d like to paint your banner in my book, if that’s all right?” Then he added, “and I’ll be sure to mark its ancient status.” Lohmen smiled, and then reminded himself of warnings about keeping the tome hidden.\r\n\r\nHe’s just a boy.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, but make sure to capture the pride of the horse. I’ll inspect your work when you’re done if you like.” The boy was delightfully precocious. Lohmen took a deep breath through his nose to abate emotion.\r\n\r\n“Who should I ask for when I’m done?” Lohmen played along, forcing a smile despite enjoying the banter.\r\n\r\n“My name’s MoShar.” Before Lohmen could say anything else, the boy took off with a pack of other children darting through the yurts.\r\n\r\nThe house of Fire Horse Fire was his first ancient banner, and given its place on the standard, the first one he could see up close. There was no wear or fray. He tried to recall the previous thirty banners, but they had been hung much higher on town and city gates. He didn’t remember any wear or age, but it hadn’t become apparent until he ran one through his fingers.\r\n\r\nPeculiar.\r\n\r\nWith no stones or gates to sit on or lean against, Lohmen sat cross-legged in front of the standard and prepared his tools. An hour later, he lowered his brush and blew softly onto the tome and its thirty-first addition, which yielded a proud smile on the face of its creator. He picked up the brush and added one more feature to the horse: a slight bend in his brow to signify the determined pride that MoShar had required.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for his work to dry, he did some basic arithmetic in his head.\r\n\r\nBanner thirty-one…of twenty-five thousand. I’ve been on the road for six days…\r\n\r\nIt’s going to take…five thousand days to paint them all…? That can’t be right.\r\n\r\nHis jaw dropped; the promised sum suddenly seemed quite paltry.\r\n\r\nTomeera had said there was no time to waste, but it hardly made sense to rush such a grand task. He pondered her haste while he closed the tome and slid it safely back into his tomesack. Lohmen had settled into an old routine: reconnaissance under the guise of dining post-illumination.\r\n\r\nEvery banner is one step closer to Thesdon.\r\n\r\nAnd Kahriah.\r\n\r\nAnd Tolo.\r\n\r\nThe community didn’t have a book binder or a tavern, nor any discernible buildings; just the circles of yurts. They were arranged around a core, and there, he found a massive fountain-like structure that would look at home in even the grandest of cities. It wasn’t carved from marble or twilight quartz, but made from countless stones of varying sizes, skillfully arranged into a communal structure. And it wasn’t water in the fountain: it was fire. Not a giant inferno, but a collection of many low fires burning independently of each other.\r\n\r\nBuilt into the circular structure were several inlets furnished with everything from metal grates to flat rocks and spits, ready to roast the spoils of a successful hunt or harvest.\r\n\r\nStrewn around the fire-fountain, thick stumps of wood were used as chairs and tables. Beyond the stumps, a set of posts were driven into the ground with short pieces lashed across them. Lohmen saw a horse tied to one on the opposite side of the fire-fountain and did the same with his own.\r\n\r\nAn old woman sat by herself on a stump and gestured to the one beside her. She smiled and he sat, placing his tomesack in his lap. “I’m Lohmen.”\r\n\r\n“It is nice to meet you, Lohmen. I am Shar.”\r\n\r\n“Kisilimli is beautiful. I’ve never seen anything like it.” The woman smiled in response, her wise eyes disappearing under old skin.\r\n\r\nThe painter dispensed with the pleasantries. “I’m looking for my son. He disappeared five years ago in Umlom. Do you remember hearing of it?”\r\n\r\n“Five years is a long time, child.” She went on slowly,\r\n\r\n“Why do you only search now? Umlom is not far.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a long story.”\r\n\r\n“I see. I did not hear of a missing boy, but I will ask my cousins in the house of Three Fires. They live quite far, but we have means to converse.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of means?” Lohmen was genuinely curious.\r\n\r\n“I cannot say, nor would you understand if I did.” She went on, “When you come upon a house of fire, ask for news of Umlom and they will tell you if there is anything to know.” Lohmen pondered this, but wasn’t convinced. Shar picked up his scepticism and laughed.\r\n\r\n“We cannot see visions in the flames, Lohmen. Do not worry. Though we are an ancient people, we were not the first. We are descendants of the house of Three Fires. It has existed since creation itself. They live on a Continent of Detection, as you might know it, but that is a more modern name.”\r\n\r\nLohmen cursed himself for getting into a conversation that began at the dawn of time with an old woman, but he paid attention to learn more about conversing over great distances.\r\n\r\n“The Three Fires have burned since the beginning and were lit by the sun itself.” Pride of history beamed through her voice.\r\n\r\n“One day, a thousand years ago, there was a violent tempest. It raged hard, but was not long. When the clouds cleared, a flame had been snuffed for the first time. It was the same day they found a stranger washed up on the shore. He had no clothes, no weapons or possessions. Not even a name. The Three Fires took the stranger in and treated him as one of their own.\r\n\r\n“But the third flame would not light. They tried different woods. Different oils. They tried praying to the sun gods. Nothing would relight the third flame.”\r\n\r\nLohmen looked up as a boy brought a large dish of meat and root vegetables and Shar offered some to Lohmen. The arrival of food made the woman’s story more interesting all of a sudden.\r\n\r\n“The stranger stayed with the Three Flames, though many believed the extinguished fire was his fault. Soon they came to blame him for any misfortunes that befell the village. What else could it be?\r\n\r\n“Then, one day, a brave little girl dove into the waters near his landing and retrieved a bag from the sea floor. She brought it to the inner fire and showed it to the flamekeepers. They did not know what to make of it, but the stranger saw it and told them it belonged to him. He did not know why; he only knew.\r\n\r\n“They allowed him to dress in its contents. When he put them on, they fit as if they were made just for him. When he hung his blade on his belt, the third flame re-ignited.”\r\n\r\nLohmen smiled as he ate, but was failing to see any relevance.\r\n\r\n“The stranger had become one of the people, received the kiss of the coals, and stayed for a time. When dressed in the things from the bag of the sea, he developed strange new abilities. That was when we learned to communicate over great distances. And short.\r\n\r\n“But the stranger did not stay. The world beckoned him. Some people travelled with him as he crossed the realms. Some settled along the way. That is how we are here.” She smiled.\r\n\r\n“That’s very interesting. I look forward to visiting the house of Three Fires someday.”\r\n\r\nShe hardened her gaze.\r\n\r\n“You do not listen, Lohmen. They were searching for answers at the flame itself. Just like you search for clues and disturb the meals of old women.”\r\n\r\nLohmen took another bite and thought.\r\n\r\nBut they didn’t know they were looking for a bag; the girl just happened upon it.\r\n\r\n“But if they had searched where the stranger landed like the girl did, they’d have lit the third flame more quickly. Where did your mystery start, Lohmen?” Her face softened as she leaned back.\r\n\r\nLohmen stopped chewing.\r\n\r\nHow did she do that?\r\n\r\n“I told you that you wouldn’t understand.”\r\n\r\nLohmen sat silently and ate, trying not to think anything ill of the woman. He thought of his son and the years he had spent looking before the commission letter had come.\r\n\r\n“Maybe you have more than one mystery.” She propounded.\r\n\r\nHe thanked her and stood. She refused his offer of coin, and the boy who had brought the food was nowhere to be found. Lohmen walked to the fire and picked up a cold piece of charcoal well away from the flames. On a page torn from his cartography notebook, he sketched the harmonious scene at the fire fountain, the old woman appearing in the foreground wise and smiling.\r\n\r\n“I will cherish this, Lohmen,” she said when he gave it to her. “Thank you. May the fire be your friend.” He nodded and left her to finish the meal. A cough came from near the woman. MoShar looked at him with raised eyebrows.\r\n\r\n“Right, of course!” He pulled out the tome and held it on display for inspection.\r\n\r\n“Very good. I like how you captured the eyes. Where will you go now, Painter?” the boy asked.\r\nLohmen smiled at him with sad eyes before stowing the tome away. The question hung on him for a moment before he answered.\r\n\r\n“I’m not entirely sure yet, but I’m going to go see a book binder.”\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",
    "Genesis Scrolls Round 1: {Forvitinn and Spinnekop: Guardians of the Cavern}\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nMay 2022\r\nMay 2022\r\n\r\nyaza\r\nMay '22\r\nName/Pseudonym: {Yaza}\r\nContact Info: {https://twitter.com/yazalight}\r\nEthereum Wallet Address: {yaza.eth}\r\n\r\n{Forvitinn and Spinnekop: Guardians of the Cavern}\r\n\r\nThe cave spirit and spider observed from a distance as the jittery adventurer slowly made his way around the narrow limestone path. The spider yawned as the adventurer cautiously stepped forward and tapped the ground lightly as if testing the integrity of the earth itself. On one side of the path was the cavern wall, the other a bottomless abyss. With each footstep the unsuspecting adventurer inched closer to the trap they had set for him. The crunching of each cautious footstep echoed through the cavern and began to annoy the duo. It seemed as if the adventurer’s pace slowed with each step. The once eager pair were filled with excitement in anticipation to see yet another adventurer succumb to the traps and treachery of the cavern. However, this particular adventurer’s cautious disposition had replaced that excitement with annoyance.\r\n\r\n“This is taking forever… he should have hit the trap already” whispered Spinnekop.\r\n\r\nForvitinn offered “I could float over and scare him to speed him up.”\r\n\r\n“No. I personally feel much more entertained when it happens naturally. Don’t forget, you bet me five flies and a small mouse he would miss the trap. They always hit the trap.” The spider began to spin a web to occupy itself from boredom.\r\n\r\n“Do you like the flies that much? Honestly, I thought you were joking about the mouse…a-a-are you going to eat it?” The dimly lit sphere shaped spirit turned toward the web which was nearly complete. Its face had two dimmed closely positioned circular sockets that served as eyes and a round mouth that never shut. Because of the proximity of its features it appeared as if the spirit were in a constant state of awe.\r\n\r\nThe spider paused for a moment to hang upside-down from its web, “In fact I do like flies very much. Eat the mouse? Oh I would never do that…I was more thinking about keeping it as a pet. What do you think of me Forvee? A monster?” the spider curiously hissed.\r\n\r\nForvee glared at the jade spider in disbelief. “For a spider, you really are odd.”\r\n\r\nRoughly the size of a common street cat the spider was an imposing size for an arachnid. It leisurely rotated on the thread of web towards the spirit until its eight violet eyes locked with the two empty sockets. “Firstly, immortal spider. The distinction is important. Besides, I told you that I think mice are delightful creatures because they have only two cute little dark eyes.” The spider turned away to hide its delight in the idea of owning a pet mouse. Rotating back towards Forvee it continued explaining “It can’t really hurt me since I can’t die… because I am immortal… so maybe I train it to bring me stuff.”\r\n\r\n“Spinny!…Shhh. You talk too much…he is about to get to the trap door” the pale spirit responded. They both turned and watched the nearly motionless adventurer move half an inch forward.\r\n\r\n“I really hate this guy” muttered Spinny. Forvee nodded in agreement.\r\n\r\nIt was by mere circumstance and by proximity that the two unlikely pair became friends through their joy of watching adventurers perish in the Stygian Cavern. Admittedly, even this entertainment had begin to wane as they had seen every variation of an adventurer meet their end. Both were cursed to spend an eternity maintaining the traps and to lead unsuspecting adventurers to their untimely demise. Their original mandate long forgotten with the passage of time. Routine had overtaken their days and with it boredom.\r\n\r\nNeither were strangers to observing the adventurers who sought the treasures which rest within the belly of the cavern. They had seen many a weary adventurer enter but never leave this treacherous cavernous trap. The adventurer took one more micro step forward as his torch began to flicker and dim.\r\n\r\nForvee uttered, “I wish I could die of old age. This is unbearable watching him. It’s not like he is going to make it to the treasure.”\r\n\r\nSpinny slowly turned toward Forvee and lifted its claw. “What if we help this guy find the treasure.”\r\n\r\nThe cave spirit dismissed quickly “Are you daft?”\r\n\r\n“No wait, hear me out…we always watch these guys fall through the trap door, get shot by the arrows in the next area or get sliced in half by the swinging pendulum when they get towards the end. And we always reset everything for the next adventurer to wander in the next week. Why do we even reset the traps each week?”\r\n\r\nWith a clueless resolve Forvee said “To make it fair for the next one? If I were a dead adventurer I would be furious that I made it easier for the next fellow.”\r\n\r\nThe spider stared stupidly at the cave spirit as if to mock him.\r\n\r\n“Fairness? You yaldson. We were cursed to do this.” Looking up and to the right, the spirit recognized this all too familiar expression of nostalgia overcome the spider as it began its monologue. “I was merely a simple shepherd tending to my flock of sheep. I led a quiet life and lived off the land without a sorrow or need in the world.\" The spirit began to mouth the spider’s words mockingly. “It has been so many ages that I have been trapped in this form that I have forgotten my own appearance. This cavern is all I know now. All this because because that warlock turned me into this bucket sized spider for refusing to sell him my favorite sheep… Woolma.”\r\n\r\nPausing for a moment, the spider exclaimed \"Why do we even protect that cumberworld warklock’s treasure? I don’t even remember his name or why we need to protect it. He said something like protect … something…I forgot what the one important piece of the treasure looks like. What good is loot to a spider or a spirit?”\r\n\r\nThe spider gracefully leapt from its web next to floating phantasm. “He seemed pretty important back then but I am fairly certain he is dead as he was decrepit looking all those years ago. I bet he is not immortal as he had difficulty getting around. I suppose he could have just become a spider but maybe being dead is better than being an immortal spider. Or so he thought…that’s kinda depressing now that I think about it.”\r\n\r\nTrying to snap his friend back to reality, “Spinny you really are a loquacious crawler. Unlike you, I don’t remember my past. I remember awakening and the warlock being there. He taught me how to set the traps and some simple magic but I don’t remember anything else. I have always wanted to leave the cavern in hopes of learning more about myself but we can’t pass by the magical barrier.” The warlock entrapped the spider and the spirit by placing a seal on the cavern’s entrance that prevented them from escaping.\r\n\r\nResigning themselves to the familiar acceptance of their fate the spirit casually mentioned “Watching these simple minded adventurers die each week gets deathly boring. Who knows, maybe if they get the treasure it breaks the curse because there is nothing for us to protect?”\r\n\r\nThe shared epiphany struck light a bolt of lightning. They both slowly turned towards each other with new resolve. Forvee excitedly said “I’ll go introduce myself to the adventurer. I’ll say I am a friendly cave spirit.”\r\n\r\n“Since when are cave spirits friendly?”\r\n\r\n“Starting now?”\r\n\r\nWith a shrug the spider resigned itself to the stupidity of the idea. “It’s worth a shot. Good luck. Don’t scare him to death.”\r\n\r\nForvee floated gracefully outside the frozen adventurer’s line of sight and floated momentarily above his head. Like a deflating balloon Forvee slowly descended until directly behind the adventurer and whispered “Greetings friend. Do not fear for I am a ‘friendly’ spirit of the cave. I’m here to - “\r\n\r\nBefore Forvee had an opportunity to finish the terrified the adventurer leaped in the air and dropped his torch. The adventurer fumbled and strained to unsheathe his sword and the spirit looked on awkwardly at this exercise in futility.\r\n\r\nOvercome with desperation, the adventurer’s backed away from the spirit drawing closer and closer to the trapdoor. Meanwhile, the torch flickered and gave its last breath filling the air with smoke. The unending darkness clouded the adventurer’s senses and panic gripped his heart. Forvee began to give off a soft moonlight glow. The sword unsheathed and a loud cry burst forth from the adventurer trembling lips “STAY BACK FOUL SPIRIT. I SHALL VANQUISH THEEEEEE.” His heart racing and his lungs empty.\r\n\r\nThe adventurer sliced through the clueless orb to no effect. They both stared at one another unsure what to do. The empty sockets staring aimlessly at the adventurer. Forvee finished its sentence “help…I’m here to help. There is a trap door behind you. I know because I helped set it.” The spirit floated toward the torch and lifted it slowly. For a moment the spirit’s sockets glowed a deep fiery orange and the torch ignited with a fantastic bright flame.\r\n\r\n“Here, this won’t fizzle out. Take it and may it light your path sluggish adventurer.”\r\n\r\nThe adventurer was confused but with one trembling hand gripping his blade he reached out with his free hand for the brilliant torch. He gripped it tightly and pulled back quickly, turning to see the trap door mere inches away from his position.\r\n\r\nWith quivering lips the wide-eyed adventurer looked at the expressionless spirit “You…you saved me?”\r\n\r\nIn a moment of brief yet woefully inept contemplation the spirit flatly replied, “Well… I suppose if you look at it that way I can understand how it may ’appear’ to you that I saved you but it isn’t because I like you. I actually had a bet with Spinny earlier regarding your untimely demi-…” abruptly catching itself mid-word as it felt the eight violet glimmering eyes hanging from the cavern’s ceiling pierce its formless soul.\r\n\r\nA quick whisper darted from above “Shut up you fopdoodle. You’ll give away our plan.”\r\n\r\nThe arachnid lowered itself menacingly from above on its silky shimmering thread behind the stunned adventurer. The reflection of the flickering fire made its eyes glow like embers as it nonchalantly hissed “We need you alive to test a theory. You haven’t really got an option if you wish to survive this treacherous place.”\r\n\r\n{part 2… in the works!}",
    "\r\nGenesis Scrolls Round 1: {Fool’s Errand: Part 2}\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nMay 2022\r\nMay 2022\r\n\r\nQuet\r\nMay '22\r\nName/Pseudonym: {Quetzelcoatlia}\r\n\r\nContact Info: { https://twitter.com/quetzelcoatlia 2}\r\n\r\nEthereum Wallet Address: { 0xcE64bA0c1A72Eb7734A03AE006Fb82f06DcFdddE}\r\n\r\n### {Fool’s Errand, Part 2}\r\n\r\n{\r\n\r\nMirror Grotto was a little observed wonder in the realm of Juwnedon-Wek on the south stormshores of the Order of Protection’s principal island. Very little was known about it, partly due to the wild remoteness of the region and partly due to the density and great variety of the demon population there, who deterred most travellers and ate the rest. The earliest historical account of the place is also the most detailed – a short passage in Phasros the Elder’s Vestigo, reading:\r\n\r\n“Of the so-called grotto of mirrors near Ninnolzhew, which may be the same wonder as the Knoll of Bones, it is said to be a demon-made construction taking the shape of a low hillock upon the landscape, the inside of which is lined with splendour and the outer with gore.”\r\n\r\nMost later texts do not mention it at all, although there is mention made in an old song of that region which mentions “yon shyning hill of bones,” which likely refers to the place, there being no real hills or mountains in that region at all. It does not feature on the majority of maps, lacking the extraordinary usefulness of The Exalted Basin, or the tragic history of The Exalted Maple.\r\n\r\nHow Prince Leif Berranek had managed to make it there unscathed was anyone’s guess. His armour was mismatched and poorly made, his sword was dull, and yet he carried with him an astonishingly rare map from the library of the royal family, printed on demonskin. This map, strange to say, had been gifted to him personally by the very same royal personages who had seen fit to send him out into the world wearing dogskin gloves. It depicted the island in wonderful detail, accurately charting a number of regions that were thought to be entirely uncharted, among them Juwnedon-Wek, the realm of the Mirror Grotto. The map had been marked for him to show the reported locations of a number of Divine Relics - those rare and curious pieces of equipment that were sought by all those who sought power, and which granted their bearers strange, wonderful gifts.\r\n\r\nPrince Leif stood just a few paces now from the Grotto, dressed in his strange garb and bejewelled crown. He consulted the demonskin map one last time. The wonder had been depicted as a low mound, and a small golden X had been painted on to indicate the presence there of a possible Divine Relic. In black ink above the mound was another tiny symbol – a six fingered hand, the mark used to denote the presence of a great demon.\r\n\r\nLeif put the map away and looked the grotto. Phasros the Elder’s Vestigo and the map had both depicted the grotto as a sort of hillock, but both sources were ancient. The Mirror Grotto had grown since those days. It jutted up into the sky now like a giant skeletal thumb, pale against the pale sky. It had looked uniformly white from a distance, but now that he was closer Leif saw the innumerable bones and skulls and ossicles that had been picked clean and pressed into the walls of the structure. The bones near the bottom of the towering structure had bleached white in the sun, but those nearer the top were newer, and were dark with blood. Above, a magpie circled.\r\n\r\nNo demon came to tear him limb from limb as Leif approached: no challenge answered his tentative, questioning call. Still, it was with great trepidation that he entered the grotto, almost holding his breath as he stepped through a doorway that no living creature but the demon Rojin had passed through for centuries.\r\n\r\nIt was cool inside, and quite silent. The high walls reached up to an open circle of sky far above through which the light poured in, breaking itself on the way down into a thousand points of brilliance, for the walls of the grotto were lined with glittering treasures from the floor to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nSo kaleidoscopic and dazzling was this effect that it took some time for Leif’s eyes to adjust, and then with a racing heart he stepped further in and began to gaze around in search of something resembling a Divine Relic. Here, he began to have his first misgivings. On closer inspection, the items lining the walls did not appear to be treasures at all, but rather a large collection of carefully curated pieces of rubbish.\r\n\r\nThere was a pair of broken spectacles, with a crack across one of the lenses. There were innumerable pieces of magenta and turquoise coloured glass – the hues commonly used in that region for ale and rootwine bottles. There were shards of mirrors, and not only shards but entire hand mirrors, wall mirrors, and (Leif shuddered to see) hundreds upon hundreds of traditional handheld demonglasses. These relics were commonly carried by villagers and poorfolk, and consisted of a piece of smoked mirror set in a little embroidered frame at the end of a stick – it was believed that they warded off demons. They clearly had not warded off the demon Rojin, who had plucked these mirrors from the bodies of the villagers he had killed, and had been setting them in the walls of his grotto for centuries. The demonglasses nearer the bottom of the walls were quite ancient: their mirrors were hexagonal instead of circular, and the surface of the mirrors were engraved with words in the old language, a practice which had died out more than two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nLeif stood on tiptoe and craned his neck to get a better look at the items higher up. Beetle wings; tin foil; silverware; what looked like a great cracked lighthouse lens. And as Leif stared in growing dismay, a dark shadow fell across the entrance to the grotto.\r\n\r\nThere in the entranceway stood the great demon Rojin themselves, in the form of a giant magpie. This shape of theirs was so large that they could not even fit their head through the doorway of the grotto: instead they stooped and pressed their enormous eye against the entrance to peer in.\r\n\r\nLeif, trembling from head to toe, drew his sword and promptly dropped it.\r\n\r\n“Whoops,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, well. What do we have here?” said the magpie. The demon’s enormous eye almost filled the entirety of the doorway. Leif backed himself up hastily against the furthest wall, and tried to think of something to say.\r\n\r\n“I am Prince Leif,” he said at last, for it seemed as if the magpie really was awaiting an answer. “Prince Leif Berranek, of the royal house of the Order of Protection.”\r\n\r\n“A prince!” The great eye scrutinised him in silence for a bit.\r\n\r\n“I like your grotto,” said Leif, weakly.\r\n\r\n“Do you?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes! Yes… there’s ever such a lot here, isn’t there? Gosh. And er, the decoration. Is it all… er… This sort of thing?”\r\n\r\n“What sort of thing?”\r\n\r\n“Bottles? Bits of glass and such?”\r\n\r\nThe eye at the entrance narrowed.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Leif, nervously. “It’s all marvellous, I must say. Jolly good stuff. Lovely bottles.”\r\n\r\n“I collected it all myself,” said the demon Rojin.\r\n\r\n“Goodness! Well! My word!” Leif cleared his throat awkwardly. “Is - is there anything more powerful here, perhaps? My map said there might be-“\r\n\r\n“I have spec-a-tacles,” said Rojin modestly. “Many pairs. Human made.”\r\n\r\nThere was a pause.\r\n\r\n“Do they – are they – do they have any sort of, er, powers?”\r\n\r\n“Light catching,” said the magpie. “They catch the light. Look!”\r\n\r\nLeif looked, dutifully. They did indeed catch the light rather nicely, but it was becoming evident that there were no divine relics to be found in this place. Rather, Leif had entered the lair of a demon that had been killing humans for centuries for their sparkly things, and he had entered it wearing an incredibly sparkly crown. He straightened it now, nervously, and watched the enormous demon eye track his movement, and remain fixed on the crown after he had put his hands down.\r\n\r\n“Are there any more of those seeds left?” said the giant magpie, conversationally.\r\n\r\n“P-pardon?”\r\n\r\nThe demon turned, and poked their enormous, sharp beak into the entrance of the grotto. The beak was long, but not quite so long that it could reach Leif, pressed as he was at the furthest end of the grotto, with a collection of cracked pince-nez digging into his back.\r\n\r\n“DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF THOSE SEEDS LEFT?” the beak said, very loudly.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Are – are you – the magpie from earlier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the magpie from earlier.\r\n\r\n“And,” Leif hesitated, thrown into sudden doubt. “You are the demon Rojin, are you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the demon Rojin.\r\n\r\nThe beak was very alarming to look at, this close. It was as black and wicked as a flint’s edge. When it opened to speak (which was also alarming) it revealed a sharp looking tongue, as black as onyx.\r\n\r\n“Those seeds,” the beak prompted.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Yes! I have more,” said Leif. “Many more. An infinite supply. My amulet can make them.”\r\n\r\nRojin removed their beak and pressed their eye to the entrance again to have a good look at the amulet. Leif could see himself reflected in the great oil-dark eye. He looked very anxious. He tried to make himself look less anxious by putting one hand on his hip in a nonchalant manner, but the results were mixed.\r\n\r\n“Did you say infinite?” asked Rojin.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Leif. “Infinite.” And then, remembering the razer sharp beak, he added hastily – “but only I can operate it. Th-there’s a knack, you know. So, you wouldn’t want to kill me for it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Rojin, rather vaguely. The eye was so large that it was hard to know whether it was staring at the crown, the amulet, or Leif himself.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Leif, firmly.\r\n\r\n“Give me one”, said Rojin. He thrust his beak back through the doorway.\r\n\r\nLeif looked doubtfully at the beak. “Well… alright. I was just thinking, perhaps, if you did have an item of power around here, perhaps you might consider trading it for some seeds?”\r\n\r\nThe beak opened as much as it could in the low entranceway, which was not very far.\r\n\r\n“Ahhh!” the beak said, expectantly.\r\n\r\nLeif unclasped his amulet and rather gingerly placed one of the acorn-sized seeds into the open beak. The beak clacked shut and withdrew. There was a pause.\r\n\r\n“W̵̠͉̽̈́̽H̷̢̘̳̪̯͌̎͋͘͝A̶̼͇̙̙̅͂͋̅͘͝͝T̵͚̪̮̱̠̬̝̑̌̑̒͗?̷̨̧̧͈̹̰̀͝?” roared the demon Rojin, in a voice like ragged thunder.\r\n\r\nLeif eyed the open doorway in alarm, through which he could just see a pair of enormous black scaley bird legs, and the white feathered underbelly of Rojin. If he ran now – if he ran quickly and darted out of the way, perhaps he could escape – but before he could put this thought into action, Rojin had put their eye to the doorway once more. The eye looked annoyed.\r\n\r\n“That was TINY. What a tiny little seed. Where are the big ones you gave me earlier?”\r\n\r\n“Th-these are the same ones,” said Leif, faintly. “There’s only one kind. They’re from the royal tree.”\r\n\r\n“WHAT?” cried Rojin. “Where are you hiding them? Where? Why? Give me one!”\r\n\r\n“You were much smaller earlier,” offered Leif, timidly.\r\n\r\nThere was another, much longer pause.\r\n\r\n“I know that,” said Rojin, haughtily. “I was much smaller earlier. Yes. I was in my smaller magpie form, wasn’t I? Yes.”\r\n\r\nThe monstrous form at the entranceway seemed to fold itself inwards somehow as if a drawstring were being pulled, and Rojin, in the form of a little magpie, hopped pertly into the grotto. Leif, who had come forward a little bit, shrank sharply back against the wall again.\r\n\r\n“Give me another,” croaked Rojin. “It wasn’t as good when my beak was big. It tasted very small. I’ll have one in my small beak instead.” They opened their small beak, demonstratively.\r\n\r\nLeif wondered whether he should put a seed into the beak, or whether that might be presumptuous.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Rojin, and rose, and grew, and in a sudden was in human form, in their cloak of black and white feathers. Their eyes were very bright and very black, just as the magpie’s had been, but were far more expressive, and regarded Leif with much curiosity and interest. Leif, for his part, was quite speechless, having never seen a demon change forms before, and having not expected such a very human looking Rojin to approach him with hand outstretched.\r\n\r\nRojin’s face - their human-seeming face - was a remarkable one. They wore stripes of black and white facepaint, white beneath the eyes; black beneath the mouth. In their face there was a suggestion of immense pride and cruelty, but at the same time something confiding and very full of simplicity. The contrast was what struck Leif at that moment, as opposite as the black and the white feathers. The overall effect was unusually lovely, a very strange beauty – Leif opened his mouth to speak and could not think of a single word to say.\r\n\r\n“I’ll try one in this form,” said Rojin. They were standing far too close. “Please.”\r\n\r\nWordlessly, Leif unclasped the golden locket, took out another seed and dropped it into Rojin’s open palm.\r\n\r\nThe demon tossed it into their mouth at once, and crunched it rapturously. “Wow,” they said. “Wow. Wow.”\r\n\r\n“Good?”\r\n\r\n“Good. Very good. Yes. The raiment, the gifting. So far, very much.”\r\n\r\nNot knowing quite what to say to this, but observing that he did not appear to be under any immediate threat from the demon, Leif said – “about that trade…”\r\n\r\n“There are more seeds?” said Rojin.\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course.”\r\n\r\n“More seeds for me?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” faltered Leif, “If… if…”\r\n\r\n“You are good,” said Rojin, nicely. “You are very nice.”\r\n\r\n“Th -thank you,” said Prince Leif.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose,” said Rojin, “that I could have another seed?”\r\n\r\n“Could I have a divine relic in exchange?” said Leif, bravely.\r\n\r\nRojin parsed this for a moment, then leaned in without any hesitation whatsoever and kissed him. It was a keen, thoughtless, fleeting kiss - all wildflowers - and it was the first time that anyone had ever kissed the crown prince Leif Berranek, although he was almost twenty eight years old.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Leif.\r\n\r\nRojiin looked pleased. They looked at his dogskin gloves, and his patched boots, his glowing armour, his golden locket and his sparkling crown. They looked at his wide, pale eyes and his parted lips and his wheat-coloured hair. “Would you like another?” they asked.\r\n\r\nLeif appeared to be struggling with how best to answer this question.\r\n\r\n“That’s alright,” he said at last, with some effort. He gazed at Rojin, quite lost for words. At first, when the demon had come up so close to him, he had become as pale as death; but now the blood had rushed back to his cheeks. “The thing is… I was actually – I was looking for items of power, you see… there may have been a misunderstanding.”\r\n\r\n“Items of power?” Rojin cocked his head to one side. “Afbrigði?”\r\n\r\n“Pardon?”\r\n\r\n“You’re talking about the calamities, aren’t you? Abrigði. Calamities. The singing swords and the burning cloaks? The little bits of talking jewellery?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” said Leif, excitedly. “That’s them! Only, we call them Divine Relics!”\r\n\r\n“What!” Rojin rather unexpectedly burst out laughing. “You call them the same word as a kiss! How funny you humans are! Ha! Ha! Ha! A kiss, I like that!”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” said Leif, blushing again. “Well. We don’t exactly –“\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said Rojin, serenely. “You like the calamities. You’d like some for the nest?”\r\n\r\n“The nest?”\r\n\r\nRojin gestured around them at the grotto. Seeing Leif’s dumbfounded expression, they added hastily - “It’s not finished. It could go much higher than this. This is just for starters. Lots of room for Abrigði.”\r\n\r\nLeif gazed around, distractedly. He looked rather flustered – his blush had not disappeared yet, and he spoke quickly and self consciously. “So there are none here? Well, that’s alright. I’m on a mission, is all. It isn’t going very well so far. I’m supposed to collect them up, as many as I can -they’re dangerous, you see. I’m not surprised you call them calamities in your tongue. Ha! Yes. I’m to send them back to the castle to be destroyed. It doesn’t matter that there aren’t any here though, after all. Hey ho! It was only a rumour. I thought that Dread Grasp might be here.”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of it,” said Rojin.\r\n\r\n“You’ve never heard of Dread Grasp? The gloves of protection?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“What, you must have! Dread Grasp! From the song!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all! What song?”\r\n\r\n“Grasping the heart of forgetting,\r\n\r\nHolding firm the threads of dream,\r\n\r\nGath’ring the stems of oblivion\r\n\r\nStitching closed the broken seam”\r\n\r\nLeif paused, embarrassed. His voice, as clear as birdsong, rang out against the eyeglasses and the mirrors and the broken bottles.\r\n\r\n“It’s about a pair of gloves,” he said shyly, rather aware that Rojin was staring.\r\n\r\n“That is a human song, I think. Could I have another seed?”\r\n\r\nLeif gave them one. The demon ate it very slowly and consideringly, looking at Leif all the while with their bright dark eyes. When they had finished it, they said,\r\n\r\n“I accept.”\r\n\r\n“You do?” said Leif. Then, “accept what?”\r\n\r\n“The gift was good. Very good. I like the gifts very much. I like very much that there is an infinite supply of gifts,” said Rojin. “I liked the song very much also. Yes. The crown is precisely to my liking. I like you very much, prince.”\r\n\r\nLeif looked at the demon gravely for a moment, as if he were unsure whether he were being teased or not. But seeing that Rojin’s expression was quite as serious as his own, he suddenly broke out smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I think I like you too, Rojin – you are not at all what I thought you would be. I am a great believer in destiny – I don’t know if demons believe in a thing like that, but – that is - it seems as if we were supposed to meet. I had a strange feeling when I first saw you. I almost felt as though I knew you; as if I had seen you before, in a dream perhaps.” He stopped, confused. Rojin looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh.\r\n\r\n“And you could help me collect Divine Relics? That’s the very thing I’ve set out to do!”\r\n\r\n“There are no Abrigði here,” the demon said. “But if those are what you like, I shall help you get some. Yes! In return for your song and your gifts and your raiment. And then you’ll see how powerful Rojin is! A strong bird! A builder of tall nests!”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” murmured the Prince, a little nonsensically.\r\n\r\n“You don’t have to decide now, of course,” Rojin said hastily. “Three moons is traditional. You can wait. You can see.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said the Prince. “And - after three moons?”\r\n\r\nRojin placed Leif’s hand into their own and laced their fingers together, six against five.\r\n\r\n“We can marry!” }\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law. Pinky\r\nMay '22\r\nNice!\r\n\r\nGreat writing mate, looking forward to more.\r\n\r\nThe only minor point I would make is to contextualize that although the Mirror Grotto is a little observed Wonder, it is so in comparison to other Wonders if that makes sense?\r\n\r\nAs there are only 50 Wonders spread out and over 1M+ player entry points from when the Lore starts for Realms, I would maybe emphasize the deaths or danger a little more. Tiny point, it is pretty clear the point you have made with the quote, but just because of how rare Wonders are thought id mention it in case you wanted to expand upon how Leif managed his feat, and how rare it is.\r\n\r\nWe got Undead Faction, Demonic Faction, and more being built out.\r\nLovely :slight_smile:\r\n\r\nAll the best mate.",

You may have such broken visions of her memories yourself. The one before me kept meticulous notes of every vision they had, looking for clues to find some of her other possessions. They believed that holding all of them would let them connect to the witch’s spirit like never before.\r\n\r\nI, on the other hand, concerned myself only with some of them.\r\n\r\nThe ones that portend great terrors for the Realm.\r\nThe ones that haunt me.\r\nThis one in particular.\r\n\r\n~o~\r\n\r\nThe Wand leads me back to the ruins. It’s been a long day. I sink onto the ground where my Tower stood tall not a few nights ago.\r\n\r\nThey were right. In the end, I failed. I failed them. I failed myself. I failed my destiny.\r\n\r\nHow could I have let this happen? How did I not see it coming? What did I miss?\r\n\r\nThe familiar feeling of bitter vitriol washes over me.\r\n\r\nNo. I haven’t failed entirely. Not yet. I may not have seen them coming, but the fools only took down the Facade. They didn’t find anything important. They didn’t take anything True.\r\n\r\nI dig my fingers into the rubble, into the ground and tune my heart and my mind to its strength and my true home within.\r\n\r\nDarkness.\r\n\r\nRelief.\r\n\r\nThe floor dissolves momentarily into ether to let me in.\r\n\r\nHome.\r\n\r\nThis place knows magic unlike any that we practise. How can it restore me so, as soon as I enter? How can it drive the world outside so far away, making everything else so unimportant? The dungeon. My home. My sanctum. All that’s interesting to me in the universe is now held between these walls. Comfort and adventure all at once.\r\n\r\nLike you, Death.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of the wand strikes a comfortable balance with the soothing smells of Death.\r\n\r\nPeaceful, calming, welcoming but also brimming with mystery and potential. Not everyone sees you that way, do they? I feel bad for those who are scared of you. For those who don’t know or understand you as intimately as I do. Well, fuck them! I’m grateful for your company. For all the things we create together.\r\n\r\nFor Amaranthine.\r\n\r\nThe coldness of the Grave Wand seeps through me into Amaranthine, lifting her from her resting place and drawing her to the workbench.\r\n\r\nI don’t need to make her for them anymore, do I? You took them all. Maybe I’ve been thinking about this all wrong. Maybe they did me a huge favour. How did I not see this before? The Tower is a small price to pay for this freedom. I can make her how I want now. I can take as long as I want making her. We can make her beautiful, Death. We can make her unique. We can make her interesting.\r\n\r\nHer body contorts into strange shapes that I had never seen before. Strange, but also somehow familiar?\r\n\r\nA lost, forgotten feeling finds me.\r\n\r\nI can do anything I want. They don’t matter anymore. Nothing matters anymore. There are no rules anymore.\r\n\r\nA violent surge of energy passes through me into her. She disintegrates into a thousand pieces and grafts herself back together onto a pair of demon wings.\r\n\r\nAre you excited, Amaranthine? How shall I make you? I didn’t think of this when I named you, but did you know, in another world, amaranth is a shade of violet? Did you know they called me Violette? Violette. The woman I never wanted to be. The woman I don’t have to be anymore. But if I’m not her, then who am I? Could I have been you? Maybe. But who are you, Amaranthine? A child that has ceased to exist. The child I could have been if not for them?\r\n\r\nI recognise the shapes her body is making.\r\n\r\nI dreamed them up in that graveyard, the longest time ago. When I first found you, Death. Do you remember? When I ran away from them. When I was hiding from them. Why did I go back?\r\n\r\nIf it was just peace, just happiness, just goodness that you took from me…… You took more. I’ll never know what I could have become.\r\n\r\nAmaranthine. A mystery.\r\n\r\nAre you a monster too? You’d think I wouldn’t have become one if not for them, wouldn’t you? But no. I think I was always going to become some version of this. This. The “Other”.\r\n\r\nA darkness enters her and spreads through her being.\r\n\r\nI should make more of you, shouldn’t I, Amaranthine? From more children that have ceased to exist. For every trick, every game they played, the child that could have existed had they not. For every -\r\n\r\nHer eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThat’s not possible. I’m imagining things, aren’t I?\r\n\r\nBut something flows from me through the Wand into her, forming dark red questions in her eyes and forever lost to me. That was a mistake. I’m losing focus. I break my bond with the Wand.\r\n\r\n~o~\r\n\r\nI try to grasp at that memory like a madwoman every time, desperately trying to hold on to what I saw in her eyes. But it slips through my mind into the far ends of my consciousness, every time, lost to me as it was to her. But I remember how it felt. That bone-chilling sense of dread. Hysterical sense of power. I cannot ignore it like she did. There is danger there. I am sure of it.\r\n}",

What am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nBitter, blood-curdling hatred seeps through me as I look at her.\r\n\r\nI thought the body was the problem. Using Violette’s body didn’t make it better. Using a woman’s body is not making it any better. That’s not it.The artist and the subject of the creation are vile, how can the creation not be.\r\n\r\nI reach out through the Wand into her mind.\r\n\r\nI’m Death. I’m madwoman. I birth affairs in which GREEN is the key to slaying me. I am a madwoman because I love death. I love the feeling of pointy things Vs. pushing vs. being combined into a one single entity.

I love the feeling of being theinkerthing.\r\n\r\nI break my bond with her and the Wand in disgust.\r\n\r\nI’ve had visions of her using the Grave Wand, making necrotic chimeras before. But did I just see her reaching into the mind of one? And did I just see its thoughts??\r\n\r\n<><>\r\n\r\nI did some digging.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t find much about Amaranthines. But there are rumours. Disturbingly more and more, over the years. Some say it was a failed experiment. I think it was a failed attempt at a self-portrait.\r\n\r\nHer creations are almost always talked about as mindless. Almost. But I found something else. A journal of an investigator found decades ago in Kaddun. He writes about encountering one of her chimeras. He said it made calculated moves. That it moved with purpose. With intention.\r\n\r\nBut surely, that’s not possible? A witch, even one with demon blood, no matter how powerful, cannot create a being like that? One that has its own mind? Has thoughts??? What does this mean? Does it have a soul?\r\n\r\nVisions such as these as known to get slightly altered each time it is recalled by an adventurer.

Everyone I bring home with me is so busy fearing you, they have no time for me. I wish, for once, one of them would actually talk to me. Say something worth hearing, for once. If they had anything worth preserving in them, I wouldn’t so easily give them to you. But they’re all the same. I wonder if there’s a way to keep a part of them in the piece, just an echo of what made them them. I’ve never let the supplies inspire the creation before…\r\n\r\nWhat of you, little child? What makes you unique? Is there any part of you worth keeping in Amaranthine?\r\n\r\nMy awareness reaches out through the Wand, searching the echo of her consciousness.\r\n\r\nFear. Horror. Panic.\r\n\r\nThey told you to fear us, didn’t they? I know known terrors seem safer than havens unknown. The monsters we call family seem safer than those they call “the Other”. But trust me, Death and I will be kinder to you than they would have been. Ask Violette. She’s thankful I took her place.\r\n\r\nAt the back of my awareness, I feel her stir. The girl whose name and life I stole. The girl that would have been Violette if not for their games. She never really left me, but without the Wand, I wouldn’t have known. She’s good at hiding at the far edges of my consciousness. I think she felt bad for me. I’ll never be sure if it’s pity or vitriol that kept her from moving on. But I know she agrees with me on this - she’s the luckier one.\r\n\r\nAnother child that didn’t get a chance to exist. I wish I knew where they hid your body, Violette. It would have been so perfect for -\r\n\r\nA blinding flash of pain shatters the bond.\r\n\r\nThis creation seems more like an expression of emotion. Usually, her thoughts are about its functional aspects and efficiency. She also sounds oddly relaxed. Why is this one different?\r\n\r\nIn all her other visions, her connection with Violette was very weak. But that flash of pain when she was thinking about Violette’s body. It almost seemed like Violette was actually responding? Did she want the witch demon to find her body?\r\n\r\nShe had all the items. She still has the ring in this vision",

Shillings for a killing!” The man cried, hocking his wares of putrid potions all with one goal. In the Dark Markets, anything goes but quality comes at a cost. A robed figure approached with a purse that clinked softly with every stride. The Bastard, as he was known, lowered his voice to capture the attention of his hooded audience. It was a keen trick he had learned over the years, making an individual out as if they had his full attention. “Only the best, nearly untraceable,” he waved his hand over a small vial with a sludge the colour of putrid milk. “None for me today,” the would-be customer replied, he had come with a purpose, “I’m only here for Furakh.” This stopped the Bastard cold. Looking this way and that before he motioned the patron beyond his stand. “That’s it for today folks! Come back tomorrow to kill your loved ones for fortune or your enemies for revenge!” The Bastard pulled a rope and the heavy velvet curtains fell shrouding them in total darkness. The robed person removed their purse and undid the tie, slowly loosening the cinch, and light started to spill forth. “Not here!” the Bastard hissed, “we must move to a more secure area.” With a great heave, he pulled the heavy chains that were covered by a box and a hatch swung open. The two descended and the tent was left in complete darkness once more. At the bottom of a spiral staircase that felt like it would never end the Bastard pressed his hand against the stones as a passageway fell into view. Torches along the wall flickered to life except for one which sputtered but never managed to catch. “Damn magician, I had these sconces installed a year ago and he’s been by twice a month to fix at least one of them. Charges me through the roof for it. Bloody extortion.” His guest said nothing. “Just through here,” and it was, for when they entered the room the visitor had never seen a dungeon so lavish. There were pelts and velvets and wines from the genesis age… And in the centre of the room, the piece for all resistance, the golden skull of Once-King Furakh. “How did you come to posses-” “Bah bah bah, show me what you’ve brought before answers are wrought,” the Bastard rubbed his hands deviously. “Geez, you sound like a Mage, talking in rhymes that way,” but the robed man began once more to undo his purse. The Bastard shrugged, “I’ve got a Mage cousin I spoke to just the other day, must have stuck in my mind.” The robed figure held out the purse, this time for the Bastard to open, the light already leaking through the cinch. With delicate hands and a ginger touch, the Bastard took the weight of the silk bag, the clinking sounding closer to chatter when held this close. He poked his finger in the top, “YOUCH!” and pulled his finger to his mouth to nurse the wound. They had drawn blood. “They’re truly alive!” the Bastard cried and poured some of the contents onto his palm flooding the room in light. Golden Ants glimmered in his hand. The tradesman flicked his hand and Ants began marching, encircling the Bastard’s wrist. With a word spoken but forgotten they clinched one to another and bonded into chains. Heavier chains than the Bastard had ever held. They dragged his weight to the floor and the Ants kept marching, binding him. “What is the meaning of this!” the Bastard cried his voice growing sore after a long day of yelling as a vendor, it adopted a shrill tinge of fear. “It’s simple, I am the Once-King Furakh, and I’m here for my skull,” the robed man walked past the Bastard and lowered his hood, revealing a bald head tattooed with two coins under either eye. “It is actually the skull of my dear brother, who took the fall when they raided our castle. I was mistaken as a mere advisory to the king. I was jailed for it but I kept my wits about me, and my head.” With emphasis, the visitor plucked the skull from the pedestal. With another unspoken word, the skull began to chip disassembling once more as a troop of Golden Ants pealing themselves from the familiar macabre shape. These marched down Furakh’s robes toward the Bastard and his chain began to spread thin, covering his body as almost like a liquid. The troop of Ants parading from Furakh joined with the greater golden colony enveloping the Bastard. “You’ll never get out of the dungeon without me! Only I know the guragghg” the Ants had found their way into the Bastard’s mouth and stiffened his tongue. “Oh, that’s alright, because in just a few moments, you will be just another thousand troops in the ever-growing army of the Once-King Furakh,” and with that, the Bastard was entirely consumed, entombed in gold. Slowly he crumbled away. And with more Ants than Furakh had entered with, he left. The doors swung open, the torches lighting just as they should, save for that wonky one. “And I’m taking this back as well,” Furakh said to the colony, as he yanked the Banner of green and black featuring chains, coins, and the golden skull of his brother…",
    "Realms Slice of Life: Dadič Writing Nov 2022 Nov 2022 Pinky Nov '22 Just a bit of stuff I wrote whilst in the hospital to practice taking the geography of a Realm into account when writing and to distract myself. Posting it before I forget all about it. Realm was chosen at random. # Dadič 1 Atlas Render 4269 1600×660 97.5 KB “LAUNCH!” Boulders that took several men to load were swiftly whipped into the air, the larger ones doused with tar pitch and tree resin in advance for this moment. Marsigt’s coarse voice commanded the mangonels at his disposal to pepper the direction of the incoming fleet’s ships with the malicious payload. His vocal cords had been worn down over decades of shouting amidst the din of war, gravelly as the stones hurtling through the night sky. A hit at the current range was unlikely, but neither was that the purpose of his ranging shots. The sea surrounding the harbor was known for its shallow reefs and made swift changes in navigation a risky proposition for a deep-keeled ship. Islands dotted the bay and a combination of low water and the ever-shifting, unpredictable tides of a planet with two moons made an accurate topographical seafloor map a necessity for any sailor that wished to avoid a lungful of water. The duress of rock by the tonnage, hurtling from above against an unskilled force could cause any slight misstep to render those maps useless; until a Captain or Second mate could re-confirm their actual position. The village towns surrounding the ports knew to keep shutters closed and reduce light to minimize accurate rangefinding during a raid. All and any advantage was to be pressed into service of war. Shipwrecks littered the sea floor around the bay, adding to the chaos of attacking the ports of Dadič. A giant ship’s rotting mast could still easily puncture a lower-class vessel. The corpse-fertilized sea garden stretched over a steep drop from shallow water to ocean deep, attracting marine predators of all sizes to feast on the remnants of a failed attack, or heavens forbid, the soon-to-be slaughtered villagers upon success. Each minute spent holding the fleet from disembarking their armies bought the defenders a greater chance of at least minimizing the damage the latest raid could do. For these ships were only scouts, the lights further out to sea told of a more significant number awaiting dawn to sail coastward. Although many soldiers might grumble at heaving the boulders up the mountain, the altitude further boosted the deadly payload of the artillery division and gave them a distinct range advantage. As his mentor taught him, anything and everything was a weapon, if utilized correctly. Captain Marsigt Marsigt.Stonewalll 1920×1920 189 KB Gravity was no exception - Marsigt made a point of specialized training for any who wished to improve its proper application with the assorted defensive ballistae and mangonels. His skill in raising new regiments up to battle hardened soldiers was why he had been sent here after all. The last raid had lost them three villages harvest and a good number of decent men and women some of whom might be the unfortunate lot on the same ships he was now systematically pushing towards doom, be it by the oceans depths or their commanders sword for cowardice. As a Knight-Captain of the Order of Brilliance, it was unbecoming to have those under his command waste ammunition on shots of no purpose. He would keep the barrage to a minimum until the probability of a hit became a near certainty, Knowledge was a currency unto its own in the Realms. This attitude exemplified the Order’s comparatively specialized and formally educated soldiers. The invader’s scouts were sent forth to reduce Marsigt’s ammunition, and he held no doubt that the bulk of the force further out to sea would calculate any sunk vessels’ location to improve their own chances of navigating the treacherous waters. “LOOSE” His following command was directed towards the division of archers, not to fire pointlessly at the incoming ships, but to alight the most immense boulders sailing through the air and let fire wreak havoc amongst the smaller ships’ timber planking. Trained from when they could draw back a modified short bow, the archers under his command could often ricochet their flaming arrows to hit up to three of the boulders in a single shot. How they managed such a feat was a bet he had painfully learned; losing enough coin at the start of his watch to never doubt their skills again. Poor bastards, Marsigt mused as the pitch tar caught alight forming streaking stars in the moonlight, Titans. Again. An assortment of their conscript crews and officers found to have erred too often by the looks. Years of naval duty in his youth had enabled him to assess the quality of a Captain by the state of their sails. No Admiral worth his salt would commit a Hartwood ship to a probing attack, let alone the dreaded Ironwoods. One good hit would assist his artillery division to better calculate their next shots. They were not overly short on ammunition, but his men’s strength was not endless, nor did they have a mage to assist their efforts. Raising his eye to the scope, he saw that he had again put too little faith in his mangonel division, for they had struck one galleon and three corvettes. Assuming that reinforcements arrived in time, he would be delighted to buy those men a few brandy casks for that small victory. A galleon’s sails had alighted and the flames allowed him to spot rowboats steadily weaving their way further toward shore. Before his night vision was ruined, he swiftly withdrew his eye and stowed his telescope. Although it was not enchanted, the Ethereal Silica optics made it a prized heirloom passed down to him from father to son. Records kept by his House, the esteemed Owl, Catapult, and Crown proved its provenance before even the Great Cataclysm. His extended family had commanded artillery divisions from the Arctic Mirror to the Dread Sea over the eons. As brothers and sisters in arms, and unfortunately, often as much against them. His conscience could rest easy tonight, for his was not a seafaring House. He held little malice for the rowboats, but knowing they were coming forth was enough to start his secondary preparations. The forty pairs of soldiers manning the ballistae were eager to add to the mayhem, and with a stream of targets coming their way, the cranking of handles clinked as the mighty strings were wrenched back. War raged eternal in the Realms, and a blood bond did not outrank a Lord’s command. Not if one wished to survive a successful battle; although it counted enough to sometimes stay the victors’ sword in the aftermath. Rare was a House that refused to inflict violence on its own, but among some of the more ancient Houses, it was known to have happened over the annals of recorded history. He held no strong hate towards the Order of Titans, indeed his sister was betrothed to a lower Lord of their Order, but this was the third raid in as many weeks. Whether they were desperate to secure a beachhead for a further assault, or simply had a poor harvest and were hoping to pillage a few granaries, it mattered not. His Lord’s command was clear, no military vessel was to make landfall. Many a Lord’s logistics relied upon the harbors of Dadič to supply their relatively meager Realms. To that end, he stepped down from the high walls and began preparations to repel any other surprises that the fleet may have in store.",
    "Genesis Scrolls Round 1: {The Colours of Light} Name/Pseudonym: {Ticklish}\nContact Info: {https://twitter.com/ticklishart}\nEthereum Wallet Address: {0xB1b3751834646fb999EDd18CA62C69663071cF43}\n\nThere was a war in Heaven. Or perhaps it was beneath the ocean, or underground. It could have waged across the three, either in turn or all at once. What is certain is that it ended.\n\nAnd even then, some Orders would say that the war continues. For though its warriors have retreated, they carelessly littered their materiel across the world. Fragments of their fearsome weapons, impossible vehicles, fabulous workshops and improbable texts are everywhere, with as many names to them as there are to birds.\n\nThough scattered and diminished, these remnants still retain great potential. A mechanism from an unknowable engine may fit around a finger, a cartridge of demonic ammunition could be fashioned into the heel of a boot. A boiler stove for a god might make a handsome set of armour for a person. And so, as people learned how to repurpose these scraps and leftovers to their advantage, they played a part in the history of almost every people of the world. Nations rose because they possessed them, and empires fell when they lost them.\n\nOne became a decoration for a baby’s crib. It was a ring of thin wire, dangling above that crib on a piece of fishing line. Light that passed through the ring was split into rainbows that danced on the walls. The crib was in a nursery, and the nursery was in a cottage of the town of Schtasspez, which flew the banner of the House of the mammoth that coiled a great tree. The town was in the Realm of Spezlaas, in the half-frozen cap of the world. Nobody recorded its discovery or speculated as to its original purpose. It had found long and good use on that piece of wire, amusing babies.\n\nOne of the last babies to use it for that purpose became a fearsome mage, who would use the ring, among other things, to force a great many changes on the world. She did not have a name when she was in the crib, for the time in which she lay there was before the traditional naming ceremony of her House. But when she had it, her name would be Spezlaasin Thint Sayadaw. ‘Spezlaasin’ was a name common to almost everyone in her home realm, ‘Thint’ was her House name and ‘Sayadaw’ was the name she was to give to outsiders. But she decided at an early age that she would refuse to give her House name to anyone and would not respond to it, an early sign of the wilfulness that would become known to all when she brought the stars to Earth. This game she played about her name became reality and so Sayadaw, a declaration of otherness, became her entire name.\n\nBut as a baby Sayadaw only cooed and gargled at the chaotic fluttering patterns of light slowly rotating around her nursery. If the two sisters that followed had not been visited by cot death in that very same crib, the ring would have remained there on its wire to distract all its successive occupants, as it had for all the decades in which her family had made a home there.\n\nBut after her second sister had fallen asleep and not awoken, Sayadaw’s mother had packed up the nursery in a rare burst of activity that came between her long fallow periods. The crib was turned into firewood and replaced with a loom that would seldom be used. The little ring had been taken off its wire and put in a drawer, where it was found by the young and lonely Sayadaw. She developed a habit of lying on her back for hours on the floor, one eye screwed tightly shut, peering through the ring as she held it aloft to a sunbeam in her stubby fingers.\n\nShe learned to experiment. When the sun went down she held the small annulus up to the light of candles, the moon and the stars. She realised that the colour of almost everything was altered when seen through it. Some stars changed colour in different ways to others. She knew that dead things shone differently to living things, that salt water was different to fresh water, and that hen eggs were different to duck eggs. As these were differences that everyone knew, the people of her House treated her with patience and good humour. This child who kept snails in a box, who hoarded jars of water and scraps of metal, who fancied herself a fortune-teller but told fortunes that were patently false and absurd, became an unofficial House mascot. She was welcome to come and go as she pleased into every home and workshop, to visit the chicken coops so long as she treated the hens well; to rifle through the bins and the cesspits so long as she washed afterwards. She endeared herself to the furnacemen at the Smiths when she declared that she knew they had changed the source of the fuel. She knew because the fire blazed a different colour through her ring. They made a deal with the girl: that if she agreed to be quiet and not yell fortunes at them, that they would make her a small tube for the ring which she could fasten to her head with a strap and wear like a long, protruding eyepatch. Sayadaw strutted around with the ridiculous brass tube on her face with the greatest pride, demanding that people admire it.\n\nOnce, when her father suffered a fit, as he did from time to time, Sayadaw stood in the doorway and watched him through her tube while her mother held him down. The patterns of light running through his neck and head were like an entirely new form of music. She was growing, and what had been a delightful eccentricity was becoming worrisome to her family. Shortly after witnessing the fit, she wandered into the kitchen of a neighbouring farmhouse and solemnly told the farmwife that the crops in her field would not grow that year. She said she had been looking at the soil and the colours of it were wrong, and quite unlike the colours of all the other fields she had seen this season. This was the first fortune Sayadaw told that became true, because she had learned that the patterns of colour that swam over fertile soil was distinct to that of waterlogged, barren or dry soil.\n\nDiscussions were had on Sayadaw’s behalf. Her mother was unapproachable or quarrelsome with most people in their House, and did not speak to anyone at all in the neighbouring Houses. Her father was too sick most of the time and spent half of each year or more in the refuge in Spozschpezh. But the nuns from the Scrollhouse in Kezkiisch had heard of this bright child and took it upon themselves to enrol Sayadaw. The Scrollhouse was aligned to the Dark Order of Vitriol, as was all organised society in Spezlaas. The Order of Vitriol had begun as a group of people obsessed with the acquisition and study of the remnants from the War in Heaven. By the time Sayadaw was ordained into Vitriol, it functioned as a de facto municipal government for much of the Northern Continent. The nuns came again and again to their home and told Sayadaw’s mother that the Mother Superior herself had asked for Sayadaw’s attendance, that she recognised that the girl had been studying a rare and useful relic since she was born. After some frustrating and confused resistance, Sayadaw’s mother relented and finally the nuns from the Scrollhouse came to remove Sayadaw and leave her mother to stare at a dusty loom.\n\nSayadaw had met nuns and monks and scribes and masters from the Order on several fleeting occasions during her explorations of the village, but had not been cognisant of there being other Orders in the world, even though she had enjoyed the travelling clown acts from the Order of The Twins and been thrilled by the endless stories of daring Sheriffs sent by the Order of Fury to fight injustice. People from the Order were simply adults, who were not her parents, that had useless jobs. Her mother made a half-hearted attempt to explain to her that she would be taught by the nuns of Vitriol how to read and write and to study the remnants they held, which sounded all well and good, but then the transport came to take her away to Kezkiisch and for the rest of her life she would only spend a handful of nights in her own bed, in her own home.\n\nTears were expected for new arrivals at the school and the nuns were experts in turning them to steam by way of scolding. But Sayadaw’s tears were of a flavour that took the nuns by surprise. There was an outrage to them that set the girl apart right away. Though Kezkiisch was one day’s easy journey away from Sayadaw’s home in Schtasspez, to the young girl it might as well have been as remote and alien as a city on the Moon. When she cried on her first day at the Scrollhouse, it was because she was so angry that no one had thought to bring her here before, to see all the people and machines and wires and horses and coal-fires. Her tears were appreciated and quelled by Spezlaasin Wioleta Ozige, a young research assistant of the Mother Superior, who took the furious little girl under her wing from that first day until Ozige’s last.\n\nSeveral of the girls at the school had arrived there with an attachment to a powerful item already formed. Sayadaw was able to negotiate with the nuns for the right to wear her eyepiece during classes twice a week. She was silently admitted to the elite clique of girls that had such trinkets, but rarely invoked this honour. She didn’t think much of the hand-me-down wands and magical hats the other girls had. She was only interested in the new insights she could uncover with the help of Ozige and the Scrollhouse’s resources.\n\nThe nuns were more concerned with her more mundane studies - scribing and languages and the ways of the Order. She had to learn the ciphers that adherents of the Order used to communicate with each other, and the way to update them after the appropriate feast days passed on the calendar. She was taught of the Order’s severe philosophy of improvement. Every adherent of the Order was heated in the crucible of precise scorn. She learned to accept the criticisms of others and how to hone the blade of her words. This idea extended beyond the sphere of the self to encompass the world, for nothing was infinite or divine to the Order of Vitriol. Everything on Earth or in the Heavens could be reduced if one had the right kind of crucible.\n\nSayadaw knew all this already, for where others saw plain light or dull dirt, she saw patterns and had learned their meanings. It was natural to her to believe that nothing was as it first seemed, and that the process of discovery was necessary, sometimes ecstatic and always disquieting. She became interested in the geological specimens held in the large Library just opposite the Scrollhouse. With Ozige’s help she fashioned a hinged box of ivory, small enough to fit in her fist. The box could hold a chunk of quartz crystal and, when shaken, would ripple out colours visible only through her eyepiece. She got into the unsettling habit of shaking this ivory rattle at mundane objects, which maddened her teachers and alienated her from the few girls brave enough to be her friends. But when she brought a tea tray into her class and said that she could use her rattle to identify a cup of poison among six cups of mint tea, a change occurred. Her teacher decided that a poisoning was as good as a beating to an impossible child and had Sayadaw and a volunteer blindfolded while the cups were shuffled, and placed Sayadaw in the crucible of her own experiment. She was allowed to use the rattle and the eyepiece to assess the cups. She said that the poisoned cup shone differently in the presence of the rattle, on account of the tiny pieces of metal in the water, and drank six cups in as many gulps. Sayadaw was certainly being honed - now she could tell her own fortune. She was rewarded by being sent to spend the rest of the day in Ozige’s cell. There she giggled to herself until Ozige returned from work and fed her honey and carob gum in an unregulated burst of pride.\n\nOne of Sayadaw’s favourite hobbies was to crack an egg over a patch of bare soil. She could see the immediate response through her eyepiece - a rippling of faint, razor-thin lightning bolts crackling out from the eggy epicentre to beyond the edge of her vision. It delighted her to know that the spilling of an egg, which was a trivial thing to everyone she had ever met, was an event of grave importance to the world of the soil. Sayadaw’s trick with the cups of tea in class was its own kind of spilled egg. Another kind of lens behind another kind of eye, watching from high above, would see the news of Sayadaw’s feat spread across the gossip grapevines of the Houses, amplified by the intelligence networks of the Orders, to reach distant shores.\n\nMuch of her early schooling was intended to arm her with knowledge of the other Orders, so when she met someone who belonged to the Order of Power she was much better prepared than she had been when she first met someone from the Order of Vitriol. In a way, everyone was better prepared for an encounter with the Order of Power because, unlike the Order of Vitriol, the Order of Power operated brazenly, out in the open. Theirs was not the way of ciphers and secrets, of cloistered chapters whispering in attics, but of a marching band with an exhaustive repertoire. An old joke - how do you tell if someone is ordained into the Order of Power? Easy, it will be the first, second and third thing they will tell you. To walk among the Realm of Vitriol was to meet ordinary people who did extraordinary things behind closed doors. In the Realm of Order, the division of labour was clear, and its adherents wore its symbol plainly on their chests.\n\n–\n\nSayadaw was approached by a Wanderer from the Order of Power shortly after her graduation. She was by then a young woman, taller than most of her classmates, with few friends and no need for more. Most of all she wanted to put the world in a crucible so she could see what it was made of. The Wanderer suggested that the Order of Power could help her with that.\n\nThe magnificent shambling man knocked politely on the door of her old home. She had returned there, to the gentle shade of the Banner of Mammoth Snake Tree, to attend to the matters surrounding her mother’s funeral. Her father had not left the refuge and his own funeral would come soon. She had swapped her old bed with the dusty loom so that she could lie in a sun beam like she had when she was small – as she was when the knock came.\n\nThe Wanderer from the Order of Power was very tall, with skin much darker than Sayadaw’s own. He had large, saucer-like eyes beaming from underneath the hood of his cloak. The cloak itself was another remnant from a lost time, a lush mane of broad-bladed grass that hung down the considerable distance to the Wanderer’s ankles. Two woven reeds hung across his shoulders, the ends of which were unseen for they sat in his mouth. Consequently, he was unable to speak, so handed Sayadaw a written message instead.\n\nIt was a flax envelope bearing the seal of the Order of Power. So it had been the first thing he had said. She broke the seal and read the message on vellum. It had no cipher and was written in the most commonly used language of the North. It was a summons to continue her education in the South East, on the distant fjords circling the Tides of Tears. She thanked the Wanderer and asked him for time to consider the decision. He produced a small scrap of paper, much rougher than the one that had been in the envelope, and scratched a response with a stick of burned willow.\n\n“You may take all the time you do require. With your permission, I will remain here outside of your dwelling until such time you need me,” it read.\n\nShe went to see Ozige, leaving the man standing on the grass with his back to the sun, slurping on his tubes. She presented the note to her teacher and surrogate mother.\n\n“You can refuse,” said Ozige. “We do need you here. The Library has centuries of research you could shed new light on. You would be made a Curator before the end of the year.”\n\n“Everything that is here came from out there,” said Sayadaw, folding the message back into its envelope. “I could fill the Library from floor to ceiling with monographs of miracles but they would be written down in code. The knowing of them would not leak out beyond the walls.” Ozige knew then that Sayadaw could not be contained, and that the things she could see were things of the Light, not of the Dark. If she worked for the Library or the Archive she could discover such wonderful things, but they would be secret, hoarded. Ozige conceded the point and, though she was trained to never allow her heart to break, she did feel a small crack within her chest.\n\nSayadaw left with the Wanderer the following day. The journey to the Realms of Power would be an education in itself. Ozige was the only one to witness the leaving of Spezlaas’ most talented student, to see someone take that unusual step across the chasm of the Original Schism, that scar that marked the division between the Light Orders and the Dark. If Sayadaw returned, she would return changed, and only the keenest eye would be able to tell the difference.",
    "\r\nGenesis Scrolls Round 1: {The first day’s tour to the Eternal Fest – by Smol the Nap (GA#535)}\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nMay 2022\r\nMay 2022\r\n\r\nwenl_01a1\r\nMay '22\r\nName/Pseudonym: wenl\r\nContact Info: https://twitter.com/wenl_01a1\r\nEthereum Wallet Address: wenl.eth\r\n\r\nThe first day’s tour to the Eternal Fest – by Smol the Nap (GA#535)\r\n{\r\nIt is an enormous orchard covering the great plain between the cities /Ksne Slugi/ and /Shezhtub/ of Gislegob. Many ancient buildings are resting in the orchard. A grand palace has Adamantine as pillars and domes and Mithral as stairs. It is clearly by ancient construction technology and ancient preference.\"The Eternal Orchard, thanks to the little Prince”, Nap muttered. He was immersed in the smell of the ripened fruits for the first moment he landed. This was Nap’s dreamland since his childhood. And this is the first time he can sense this land in real, not from lores, tales or dreams.\r\n\r\nGAs usually can have a chance to attend the many festivals held in Gislegob now and then. But it was never Nap’s turn to join such a trip. “Smol”, one high mage started to call him that, and he gradually became “Smol the Nap”. “I would be lucky to find another GA with lower ratings than myself.” He would always say this when he turns nervous. And yet it is a statistical truth. This might also explain why more training courses await him than any other GAs.\r\n\r\nThe first thing he will do is taste the ripened fruits, as many as he can. He used to eat the unripened before. Only the unripened can transport over long distances to reach his hand back in the mosque. The unripened remains green, tastes sour and makes people clear-headed. Most importantly, it can be the cure to the plague, so it is essential for sailors heading on a long trip.\r\n\r\nThe ripened tasted very different, mainly the sweet and lesser the sour. After the bite, the smell is even more pungent, mixed with the warm and soft atmosphere. Nap starts feeling dizzy. It was supposed to make people think clearly, even enlightened. And that is a blessing only within Gislegob as the proverb says, “the ripened won’t travel”.\r\n\r\n“Does that taste good? Your mighty adventurer.” The voice brings Nap back and gives him a quiver. A mythical ring from the very loot bag! That is the first thing Nap noticed when he looked at the person asking. Another young adventurer who is almost as young as Nap himself. But there’s no chance that the young man has a lower rating than me, not even close, Nap thought.\r\n\r\nDivine or demon, noble or lowborn, no one will carry a weapon into The Eternal Orchard. Since neither the divines, the demons or the mortals can afford to ruin the orchard, there is an agreement that there is no war or even dispute within Gislegob Land. The significant deal was made after an ancient war in the age of “Before Genesis”. The ancient war almost ruined the orchard. The ancestors decided to have a truce and protect the orchard together. It was since then that the orchard was blessed with peace. Gislegob Land was excluded from wars from then on.\r\n\r\n“Are you a Demon? Did I witness a demon taking the fruits? I never saw people trembling when taking the fruit. And you are not talking. Maybe the demons are speaking a different language than I do.” The young man talks a lot, and Nap knows he is joking. But Nap got the point about the demon joke. In one of the many scrolls, he read that Demons eating such fruits could slow down a kind of decay in their body, but the effect would not last. There are tales about people who have seen demons taken enough such fruits had turned into a magnificent, beautiful form. Some believe that was the original form of all demons.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the ripened is so different from the unripened. Nap looked back to his hand, it was a deep purplish-red, and the colour was even deeper where he bit. “That is my first time having a ripened. And I am going to take much more.” Nap finally replied.\r\n}\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

Someone who would possess a pendant of power like the one Fe now wore around his neck.\r\n\r\nNo one knows exactly what, but something happened to the line of Evermorns; it was surely dark and disastrous. An event so horrific that it changes the trajectory of a family’s history forever. Something that caused this beautiful pendant of power to be known instead as the “Dread Bite” and imbuing it with a mysterious and tragic sort of magic.\r\n\r\nAfter working as a smith for over 20 years, and apprenticing for five years before that, Fe was sick of living in Schlel. He was ready for adventure, to travel beyond his realm of lel Kúbklor and to see new sights and have experiences he had only read of in books. Fe made a vow to himself that night: he would take the first boat out to sea that would give him passage.\r\n\r\nThe Night at the Viper Tavern\r\n\r\nThat night, Fe went to the Viper Tavern, named after a local dungeon, not too far from the city. Fe had his usual, a strong ale with a dram of Hardguzzle, a spirit made from Malfour cactus that lel Kúbklor was renowned for distilling. Fe knew that crews often visited the Viper Tavern prior to a long voyage—it was a departing tradition for the men to get good and drunk before they hit the open water, passing through the Tides of Tears, through the Sea of Hermits and to the rollicking Dommian Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the luck of his long-lost ancestor was bestowed on Fe that night. Not only was there a crew ready to set sail the next day, but he also overheard a captain and his first mate deep in conversation and concerned: their blacksmith had fell ill and they were worried that the voyage would have to be delayed.\r\n\r\n“You know that now is our only chance,” the captain said. “We are three months from the winds of the North blowing in and we must leave now as it is more than a two-month journey and we don’t even know exactly where The Maelstrom is located. As soon as the air has just a bit of a chill the creature goes dormant, and the island is submerged.”\r\n\r\n“But where are we going to find a smith in such order? And one that can forge cold iron, none-the-less. It’s a lost art and we are losing time,” the first mate replied. “Face it cap’n, this voyage is going to have to wait for another day. Thou mayest want to quest, but Odin has other ideas; heed his advice.”\r\n\r\nFe heard everything. He knew he had his chance, but had Odin made the ship’s smith ill so the boat would not set sail? Or was it so that Fe could seize this moment and leave? While Fe never considered himself one to give his opinions on metaphysical matters, he had to make a choice, and decided that it was the latter, sidling up the table of the captain to make his case.\r\n\r\n“I can work cold iron to be the sharpest blade or the strongest greaves,” Fe spoke, finding his courage after a swig of Hardguzzle. “If your mission needs a blacksmith, then look no further than the person who sits in front of you here. I’m ready to leave Schlel as soon as I can find passage.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, man! And how do we know you can work cold iron like you say? Plenty of people claim to have skills to get out of this pitiful city but are as worthless as a wooden shield when battling a fire breathing dragon” the first mate said with a sneer of mockery, spitting on the ground.\r\n\r\nFe pounced, grabbed the first mate and placed him in a headlock, putting a knife to his throat. “You tell me if this knife is sharp enough, for it was forged from my own hands,” Fe snarled, nicked the man’s skin and threw him to the ground.\r\n\r\n“All right, you’re in,” the captain spoke, putting an end to the theatrics at the tavern. “But you need to know what you’re getting into. This is no ordinary seafaring journey of transferring commodities from one port to another. This is an expedition into the heart of the Dommian Ocean to a place feared by even the most tenured sailor.\r\n\r\n“We are going to The Maelstrom, a place that many don’t believe exists, but one that I’m confident I will find. Legend has it that years ago a dark mage of power ventured into the open sea in search of a monstrous creature that he believed he could tame with his sorcery. The mage felt that once this monster was in his control, he would be able to rule of all realms, an unstoppable force that no one would dare challenge.\r\n\r\nThe mage set off with only one deck hand to help with the sails. The pair traveled day and night in search for the mythical beast and would only return to port after several epochs where they’d resupply and set sail the next morning.\r\n\r\nLegend has it that the mage found the creature, but it was far more powerful than he could have imagined. The beast spun an incredible whirlpool; at the center, was the tip of an island that became more and more visible as the rushing waters spun faster and faster. All the sudden, the beast rose out of the water, smashing the small ship with its enormous tentacles. The mage was on the demolished vessel, sucked into the center of The Maelstrom towards that island, while the deck hand was cast outside of the wake, clutching to a few boards.\r\n\r\nAll of sudden massive waves clapped together from the perimeter of the whirlpool, submerging the island in a wall of water and drowning the dark wizard, along with his ghost wand and other magical items from the Order of Power.\r\n\r\nThe deck hand miraculously escaped, floating through the ocean on some of the wreckage before washing ashore in in Guz-Metmas of the Kezgep-Mas realm. There, he told everyone his tale and it became a bit of local legend. None believed him at first, but over time, ships began disappearing in the middle of the Dommian Ocean, especially at this time of year. Some say that the beast is most active now, before the cold winds of the North blow in.\r\n\r\nWe aim to prove the legend is true and want to recover all the treasures from the sunken ships, along with the items of the dark mage, especially his powerful ghost wand. We believe that the beast hates the cold, which is why we need a smith to fashion weapons from cold iron. That’s why we docked in lel Kúbklor, to stock up on raw materials that can be turned into spears and cannon fodder over the long journey to The Maelstrom. If you’re up to the task, I’m ready to take you aboard.”\r\n\r\nFe felt that the captain’s story was nothing more than fantasy, lore of the sea that sailors tell to keep their minds off the drudgery of work. But what did he care? This story was his ticket away from Schlel, let them believe what they want if it got him on a boat.\r\n\r\nFeigning deep thought at the decision, Fe ultimately nodded his head in agreement. The captain hired him on the spot; the first mate’s pride badly bruised. Fe was flush with excitement and became drunk on beer and his good luck, concerned not for the danger that was ahead of him.\r\n\r\nThe Journey Begins\r\n\r\nThe crew embarked for The Maelstrom, leaving Schlel early next morning. Even though Fe was green when it came to sailing, his position as the ship’s smith earned him a place in the officer’s quarters and the luxury of having only one roommate, instead of 15. He had his own shop to work in and got to eat in the mess hall before the rest of the men.\r\n\r\nBut the fact was that he was an outsider. He didn’t have any practical seafaring experience, which made him loathed by many in the crew and officers alike. While he found no counsel with the elites, Fe could feel the daggers of the crew’s eyes as he ate before them. “Let them stare,” he thought, “for if The Maelstrom actually exists, which it certainly does not, my weapons will be their salvation.”\r\n\r\nTo combat the loneliness of sea, Fe immersed himself in his work. Truly, no one had seen anything like him before—the sound of hammers banging metal rang out from his shop at all hours of day and night. Slowly the crew’s disdain gave way to admiration for the quality of arms that Fe produced. But has he continued to make spear after spear, the men’s feeling of awe became one of fear as the crew began to wonder, “What kind of monster are we to battle at The Maelstrom that would need this kind of armory? What fate awaits us in the open sea?” they thought but dared even to speak those words aloud.\r\n\r\nEverything Goes Wrong\r\n\r\nThe crew had been at sea for just over three months and the air was beginning to turn crisp. The captain thought that the journey was sure to be a bust; he had already begun working on what he’d say to the lords who had invested in this venture. They would be disappointed that he would return home empty handed, but the chances of success were small. Surely these men of means would understand that it was a long shot in the first place.\r\n\r\nAll the sudden, a call came down from the crow’s nest, “I see somethin’! I see somethin’!” a sailor shouted out from above. “Other there! The ocean is, I don’t know, swirling like I have never seen before. Aye, cap’n, the water is churning like nothin’ else! Over there! Starboard! Look!!!”\r\n\r\nThe captain went on deck, climbed up a mast and looked out in the distance. By Odin, the water was spinning around like a great circle. Was this the beast he had been seeking? Had his ship finally reached The Maelstrom? He went into his quarters and prepared for the monster, donning his chest armor, gloves and belt made from demonhide, the strongest material for battle known to the realms. These items have been in his family for ages and putting them on he felt braver to face what lurked beneath the surface. At the minimun, he thought that he looked the part of an Adventurer even though he felt a chill to his very marrow.\r\n\r\nAt the last moment, he took off a glove and slipped on his titanium ring from the Order of Power that was a gift from the father of his bride. “For good luck,” he thought as he walked out of his quarters, “we certainly will need it.”\r\n\r\n“Men, what lies beneath these waters is the most dangerous beast any of us have ever seen or imagined. But this is why you are all here! You said you wanted adventure? You said you wanted verses sung about you throughout the ages? You said you wanted treasure?!” the captain proclaimed to a roar of approval. “Aye men, your day has come! Grab the spears, load the cannons, it is time we kill this Kraken of the sea! It is time to show the beast that no crew from the Order of Power is afraid of it! Take your stations!”\r\n\r\nWhile the men moved on the deck, Fe could only stand there in shock. While he certainly wanted adventure far away from the monotony Schlel, he also wanted to live a full life. Seeing this whirlpool form in the distance, he felt a disastrous outcome lay before him and felt a pang of regret in leaving his friendly confines. But was that life of boredom one worth living? No, he reminded himself, tucking his pendant under his shirt and grabbing a spear. He would go down fighting with the weapons he had forged.\r\n\r\nAs the ship drew closer to The Maelstrom, Fe saw at the center of the whirlpool the island that the captain had spoken of long ago in the Viper Tavern. The waters continued to churn, creating a vortex at the center where the island became more and more exposed. Fe could see countless numbers of shipwrecks.\r\n\r\nBut where was this beast that caused the waters to rise? Fe tried imagining the size of this monster that could churn open water seemingly on command, when a tentacle, larger than any ship he’d ever seen, broke through the water and tried to slap their ship.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, all the men froze, gazing up to the sky at a writhing limb that seemed as though it pierced through the depths of the underworld. But regaining his composure, the captain steadied his crew and told them to take aim; on his command the cannons thundered, and the men flung spears at the beast.\r\n\r\nThe kraken’s howl was shrill and guttural, shaking the moon and the sky with reverberations through the cloudless night. The captain realized that he had been correct in assuming the cold iron would cause great harm to the beast. Feeling more embolden than afraid, he encouraged his men to ready the next assault when he eyed a small, wrecked ship constructed in an ancient style on the Eastern part of the island at the center of The Maelstrom. At once he knew it must be the boat of the dark mage from long ago.\r\n\r\n“Fe! Grab some spears and the strongest long sword you’ve made. You wanted adventure? Come with me,” the captain howled at the blacksmith. “We’re boarding that raft and retrieving the ghost wand from the isle over there.”\r\n\r\n“You’re mad!” shouted Fe. “What spell are you under?! There’s no way we can get past the Kraken and even if we do, how will we return?”\r\n\r\n“Listen man and listen well. The crew is brave, and your armory is as strong as any of legend but look at that beast. We’ve managed to hit only one of its arms and yet we’ve gone through a tenth of our munitions. We don’t stand a chance fighting it this way. But the crew may buy us enough time to retrieve the ghost wand, which can help us slay this beast. My family may be of the class of hunters, but in telling me the legend of The Maelstrom, my father taught me a spell should I ever recover the weapon. This is our only hope,” the captain said with desperation in his voice. “I need another man to help me row this raft and you’re the strongest one I’ve come across. Come with me.”\r\n\r\nFe did as he was told, and he and the captain boarded the raft as the captain relayed his plans to his first mate. Another tentacle rose into the air, this time the captain’s right-hand man gave the order to attack. The two men started rowing, every ounce of their energy going into the oars to overcome the waves that crested above them. At one time, an arm of the kraken came crashing down beside them, only to wash away the weapons that Fe brought on board. But the two held fast to their oars amid the chaos, pressing on.\r\n\r\nMiraculously, the pair made it to the island and crashed the raft into the Eastern shore. Time was not on their side; the captain estimated he heard six rounds of cannon fire and knew there were only enough munitions for a few rounds more. But there, beside their raft, was wreckage with ancient runes in faded fabric on a sail that was tattered and worn. This was the ship of the dark mage; the captain was certain of it.\r\n\r\n“Find the wand and give it to me as soon as you do!” the captain shouted. “We are running out of time Fe!”\r\n\r\n“Wait! Before we begin our search, tell me the incantation in case you fall. You’ve come too far to let that secret go with you in death,” Fe hollered. “I’ve proven a faithful hand; I deserve to know it should I find the wand and cannot find you!”\r\n\r\nThe captain realized that Fe was right and trusted the man; he had proved himself loyal and there was no reason not to withhold the spell from him. He shouted the words to Fe, and both men went to searching at once for the missing wand.\r\n\r\nBOOM! The air shook with another round of cannon fire. The captain knew there was one round left before his men would be out of ammunition and the creature from the depths would smash the ship to pieces. He had to find the wand if there was ever a chance to save his crew. The captain panicked as he searched the wreckage, but nothing was to be found.\r\n\r\nWhile the captain was anxious, Fe felt a surreal sense of calm. The pendant around his neck seemed to sooth him, while prompting him to go down into the depths of the wreck. He went willingly, not questioning the odd feeling, when suddenly he spotted a chest with a broken lock. Fe pried open the box and mixed in among the sunken shekels were a divine hood and slippers along with a gnarled wand unlike any he had ever seen: the ghost wand of the dark mage.\r\n\r\n“I found it! I found it!” Fe shouted, joy in his voice. “Captain, come quick, I found it!”\r\n\r\nFe heard the quick steps of the captain above board and knew that the man would be thrilled at the discovery. But as the captain descended the stairs, his foot went through a rotten plank. He twisted his ankle and fell, hitting his head on the wreckage below. Fe went over, but the captain was unconscious.\r\n\r\nBOOM! This sound was not quite as powerful as the last; Fe knew that the ship was out of cannon fodder. But he couldn’t leave the captain knocked out at the bottom of this ship’s hull. Gathering the magical items from the chest, but leaving all the coins, Fe began to pull the captain up the stairs, struggling with every step. He knew he must cast the spell if the crew were to live but doing so now would be certain doom for the two of them it succeeds. Fe had to get to high ground so that they wouldn’t be submerged when The Maelstrom subsided.\r\n\r\nBut time was running out. There was no longer the rumble of the cannons; in fact, there was an eerie sense of quiet over the ocean, the water was no longer churning but began to calm. Then out nowhere the beast rose from the sea, not just a tentacle, but the entire monster. Six arms flailing in the air ready to exact its revenge on this wooden vessel that caused it so much pain.\r\n\r\nEven though he was not high enough, Fe knew that this was the moment he must act, or the crew would be doomed. With his left hand, he clutched the Doom Bite pendant and with his right hand pointed the ghost wand at the kraken, shouting the spell with every fiber of his soul. A blinding flash consumed the sky along with a thunder of 10,000 war drums.\r\n\r\nEverything went black.\r\n\r\nThe Adventurer Rises\r\n\r\nFe didn’t know how long he was knocked out, but from the stubble on his face he knew it had to be several days. When he came to, everything ached, but he was relatively unharmed. Around his neck was the Dread Bite pendant and next to him was the captain, still and without breath, alongside the ghost wand and the divine hood and slippers Fe had taken from the chest.\r\n\r\nLooking around, he could see no traces of the beast nor that of the ship. Grief washed over Fe as he realized at once that he was alone, marooned on the island. Tears of anguish swelled inside him, but Fe buried them. There was work to do.\r\n\r\nThe captain was a good man, and as was the custom of his people, he prepared the body to be burned on a funeral pyre. “Odin, allow me the strength to mourn once more,” he prayed. Fe removed the demonhide gear from the captain and dressed himself in them. “If I shall find his family, I will return these,” thought Fe. “Until then, may they give me great power in my attempt to survive.\"\r\n\r\nFe looked at the hood and slippers and knew they were powerful totems. Rather than carry them, he thought he might gain more strength by putting them on. He took the ghost wand and could feel its power coursing through his body, it was as if he were destined to be holding it, and Fe felt an ease with the magical weapon. As if the Dread Bite spoke to him, he knew the spell to cast to start a fire in which to burn the captain’s body.\r\n\r\nBefore Fe placed him on the flame, he caught glimpse of the ring and removed it, \"This too will go to his family,” Fe said aloud, placing it on his finger.\r\n\r\nAs the smoke rose into the night sky, Fe realized just how far he was from Schlel and how slim the chances would be he would survive. But a sense of confidence began to swell inside of him, feeling the power of the magical items now in his possession.\r\n\r\n“I will survive,” Fe spoke, not to give himself words of support, but rather to affirm his fate. “It is my destiny to survive,” he roared at the heavens, no one else around to hear his cry. “And this wand shall evermore be known as the Maelstrom Whisper, for silencing the beast of the sea!”\r\n\r\nItems from the Lootverse referenced in this story:\r\nGenesis Adventurer #530: Hrothfeond Evermorn an Adventurer of Power\r\nRealms (for Adventurers) #26: lel Kúbklor of the Order of Power, Schlel is a port city of this realm\r\nRealms (for Adventurers) #6382: Kezgep-Mas of the Order of the Twins, Guz-Metmas is a port city of this realm\r\nCrypts and Caverns #5409: ‘The Maelstrom,’ a legendary dungeon where the battle takes place\r\nCrypts and Caverns #7216: Grotto of the Viper, the dungeon for which the tavern is named after\r\nRealms Atlas: For names of the different bodies of water\r\n\r\nThis is my first work of fiction that I’ve ever “published,” I appreciate the Open Quill foundation for giving me the nudge to be brave and write it.

    "\r\nGenesis Scrolls Round 1: Something More than Loot Itself (Part 1)\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nMay 2022\r\nMay 2022\r\n\r\nTheLorecraftersGuild\r\n\r\n1\r\nMay '22\r\nSomething More than Loot Itself\r\n\r\nWhenever the bell rang, a man died, and Muirin found herself lying all over again. This time it was in the village green, presided over by the carnations and daffodils. It was often held in the village green actually, she supposed that was for the same reason her cottage faced the sea. They stood in a line, on a dreary march, all the villagers, and Muirin kept herself towards the back. There she would count the town marks she had clumsily stitched into the folds of her dress. Three coins. Just enough to pay, but equally enough to seem poor. Of course, she’d have to beg, but in the end the coins would be enough.\r\nThe first scream came earlier than expected. It was a man, as far as she could tell, who had been in the middle of a high-pitched wail when his timbre choked out. Then it was just silent. Commotion broke out in the line, but nobody broke from the line, it simply moved forward, and everyone took a pace closer. Muirin could see the people fidgeting nervously, most with near-empty pouches, others just twiddling the lining of their straw hats.\r\nWhen she came close enough to see, she saw it was much the same as usual. It was her. The woman sat in a seat of gnarled branches as the villagers approached her. Out of the corner of an eye you’d mistake her for a young woman, elegant, even beautiful, with snowy locks raining down her shining cheeks. The vision only faded when you stared directly at her, making way for something older. You couldn’t call her a woman, she was more like a creature of the dark, a hobbled over old thing with deep lines accentuating her face and a grin that was pure with malice. That laugh was what gave it away.\r\nMuirin came into the green and saw for the first time that day, what she could see any other time she wanted, the statues. The chiselled crude stonework of people caught in the moment, half-contorted in fear, while strangled screams still wait to escape from their mouths. There had only been one addition today, which was unusual. It was an older man, Muirin recognised him as a farmer who kept a farm near the old forests. The passing winter had obviously done him no favours.\r\nApproaching, Muirin ruffled her dress so she could place herself down on her knees. They creaked beneath her weight, as old bones were bound to, but she managed just fine. Without a word, she placed the three marks before the authority and kept her head down. It would be enough, she assured herself, but only just. Tayv, as the villagers called her, simply stared, as if trying to see some truth in Muirin.\r\nIt didn’t take long for her to reach out and snatch the coins. Not a word passed between them, a fact of which Muirin was grateful for. When it was done, she pushed her way through the forest of statues and back on the path that led home. Muirin was eager to get behind closed curtains before the sun had fully retreated.\r\n\r\nThe cork came stubbornly from the bottle, but the rum poured like a fine wine. When she had first come here, she had been content to drink from the bottle itself, but as the years had grown on her, she found she preferred a glass. Sitting on the edge of her room, rug curled up in the corner, Muirin hefted up the whining trap door. Inside, a sizeable chest, which took more than a bit of groaning to heave next to her bed.\r\nA swig of rum and she had the key in hand. Muirin unlocked the chest and threw open the lid. There, inside, coins and jewels more than a person could ever count. Muirin ran her fingertips over the tally marks on the inside of the lid. There were three hundred and twelve of them, she had counted each mark herself. She took another solemn sip and threw the extra coins, from the folds in her dress, into the chest.\r\nMuirin had the dagger in her hands even before the creak at the door. The boy couldn’t have been more than five, rubbing his eyes for the stinging light of her candle. With a small grin and a light chuckle, Muirin replaced the dagger in the concealed sheathe at her waist and brought the boy into her embrace. Placing the lid closed, she easily scooped the scruffy adolescent up and helped him back to the room directly next to hers.\r\nThere were two beds inside, one was occupied by a girl a little older than the boy, currently sleeping sweetly. Muirin placed him in the next bed and stayed with him a little while they glanced out of the window. Beyond its fragile panes the sea came gently in and then gently out again, leaving only an impression on the sand. That was all the boy needed to be seen off into the night, and he did so without a worry. Muirin was different.\r\nYou could hear the rowdiness across the village in the local pub. That’s how it often was on the night after the tithing. What little marks the villagers could get away with, they’d spend on drinks and jubilation and then be worse off in the months to come. Muirin had always longed to go to them, in the same way she used to. To drink the place dry, to fight until her knuckles were nothing but bloody stumps, and to shame any man who could claim she was hers.\r\nWhat had she been then?\r\n\r\nMuirin had not been to the old forests in some time and thought there not a day better in recent memory for the journey. The air was stale, yet pleasantly warm, and from here you could continue to listen to the ocean. At some moments, you could even see it. Muirin didn’t like to be out of sight of the water, and she’d prefer it if she could see the waves. The two children ran excitedly about, not a care in the world, and went at the task of finding mushrooms for dinner. She couldn’t help but smile at them, in the proud way only a mother could.\r\nAt one point, they went out of her sight, and she kept to her own basket. They followed the path right through and the children knew how to keep to it. On Muirin walked, slower than she would’ve liked to, but almost came to a stop at the sight of the woman walking towards her. Another older woman, not an uncommon sight in the village, but one she knew by name. The woman wore a sombre expression, as if tears threatened to break any moment, and walked with an imperceptible limp.\r\nIt was the farmer’s wife, the recent addition to the village green.\r\nLike a stranger on the street, Muirin elected to ignore her, content to hold up her chin and simply stride by without a word. The widow had other plans though. As soon as she was within an arm’s reach of Muirin, she began to spit a vile string of words at her. Muirin stood there, indifferent.\r\n‘What do you want from me?’\r\n‘I know who you are,’ the woman snapped back. ‘I know what you were.’\r\nThe second of silence portrayed more than Muirin would’ve liked to control, but she shrugged, ignoring the irregular beats of her heart. ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about?’\r\n‘You could’ve saved him,’ she spat. ‘You could’ve saved a lot of people. Where is it now? Where is the gold you’ve taken?’\r\n‘You’ve got me for someone else,’ said Muirin. ‘I’ve lived here all my life.’\r\n‘The only place you’ve lived is the sea.’\r\nMuirin had been keeping her mind on her dagger but had never bothered with her hand. People around here were fraught for justice, and in the absence of good leadership, they took it in any way they could think to. A body in the woods would bring unwanted attention. While she knew she could slit her throat, she decided against it. It would only prove there was more to Muirin than she wanted there to be.\r\nThat’s why, when the widow pushed her, Muirin fell backwards almost voluntarily.\r\nThe way down was steeper than she had expected, more of a short hill. She tumbled past trees and through loose branches, over rocks and between stinging nettles. A rough fall for what seemed a long time, before landing, twisted on her back, right at the bottom. It took her a moment for her senses to come back to her. Muirin heard nothing of the widow, but that was a problem in of itself. Had she really been recognised and how?\r\nWith a groan, Muirin pulled herself up. Aches flooded her body now, screaming at each of her joints. She’d landed roughly on her back, which was now overwhelmed with the scrapes and scores of the stinging nettles. It would be a long climb back up, if she decided to go that way, and her children would be none the wiser.\r\nFinally, she took the moment to look around at where she had landed. It was an overgrown nightmare of weeds and branches. Roots shot out from the ground here and up the steep rise she had tumbled down. It harboured an odour as well, and she didn’t think she’d have to travel far to find a bear’s den.\r\nMuirin caught her first glimpse of it as she found her feet. It was an easy thing to miss, hidden beneath the unkempt wilderness, but unmistakeable when you saw it. There was a woven sack, a bag, sitting there as if it had grown there. As if it were another fruit within the forest. At first, Muirin thought it might had been thrown from the path, a bag of something rotten given as a gift to the weeds. And then her curiosity came to her.\r\nThe bag was far heavier than it had any right to be. Opening it gave her an immediate sense of unease, as if she had stumbled upon something forbidden, something not meant for her eyes. There were items inside. Many items. Some looked mundane, others looked exotic, but they all felt strangely powerful. It seemed as if they shouldn’t all fit within the same space so comfortably, but they did so without complaint.\r\nMuirin reached for a falchion, a familiar weapon in her hands, and held it aloft to the sun. She didn’t know how, and she couldn’t guess at why, but this was no ordinary falchion. Nothing in this bag was ordinary. Although meetings with magic were rare in her life, she could say with some certainty and without a lick of training that these items were magical.\r\n\r\nMuirin sent her girl towards the village first and only approached after she was sure there wasn’t any angry mob waiting for them. Returning, they found a pleasant welcome amongst the locals. A traveller couldn’t tell that, only yesterday, most of these people had been scared out of their minds. Things had resumed as normal. Those that knew Muirin and her children greeted them amiably, but always Muirin kept her eye out for the widow. She wasn’t in the village green, near her recently petrified husband, which meant there was only one other place she could be.\r\nThe day was waning but not dark when Muirin arrived home alone. She had told her children to visit with the baker woman nearby, who had children of her own close to their ages. Muirin opened the door and was not at all surprised to find her home ransacked. The furniture had been flung in every direction, cups and plates smashes, the walls bruised and dented, and any pictures that had been hanging from hooks were now on the floor in pieces.\r\nThe widow was sitting in her bedroom, legs crossed, with a grieved look upon her face. ‘I know it’s here somewhere.’\r\nMuirin already had the dagger in her hand, she entered slowly, cautiously. ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about. What have you done to my home?’\r\n‘I remember seeing daddy when the first arrows hit.’ The widow seemed away from them now, away from the room, lost in the swirling nepenthe of her memories. ‘They stuck him like a pin cushion, then the rest of the crew. I hid beneath the netting and the crates, and I don’t think you ever saw me, or ever cared to see me. I can remember your face.’\r\n‘I’ve seen you moving about the village,’ replied Muirin. ‘If you think something of me, why hasn’t it come to anything before now?’\r\n‘First time I saw you I was sure,’ she replied simply. ‘Next time, I was less sure. For years this went until your face faded into the others around you. Then when…I started remembering the rumours about you. A small cottage, never bothered near the sea, with only one small orchard and a band of clucking hens to provide for it.’\r\n‘You’re just looking for a face for your misplaced anger. I ain’t nothing to you.’\r\nThe widow stood up then. ‘You’ve hidden whatever you have well enough. Is it hidden from the prying eyes of magic though? What if Tayv were to look for it instead?’\r\nMuirin’s knuckles went white around the hilt of the dagger. ‘Are you saying you mean to do something foolish now?’\r\n‘Not unless my memory is right,’ replied the widow. ‘And that your ill-gotten gains are shared.’\r\nThinking on it for a moment, Muirin lowered the dagger and stepped aside for the widow. The woman strode confidently past her and had no way of knowing just how fast Muirin was. The woman had the widow’s forehead struggling against her hand in the next second, and the blade of the dagger running across her throat in the second after. There hadn’t even been enough time to scream. Statues screamed, Muirin thought to herself as the widow’s weight collapsed beneath her, corpses were silent.\r\n\r\nThe last strike of the shovel came some hours into the early morning. The hole in the sand was sizable and waiting for the widow. There were benefits to living in the last cottage towards the sea, it gave you an easy access to the beach and the waters below, but dragging the weight and then digging out the sand had more than tired Muirin. She worked with a sweat to get the body in and buried. In the dead of night, at least, she was sure no one would see her, the real problem would be digging it deep enough for the seagulls not to know it.\r\nHer boy was waiting on her bed when she returned. Muirin had already retrieved the children from the baker and put them to bed, telling them with no shortage of discipline that they were not to leave the house or wonder where she had gotten to. The boy, as sleepy-eyed as ever, continued to yawn and looked on the near verge of collapsing.\r\nMuirin put him to bed with the view of the beach beyond the window. With daylight’s approach, it was easy to see the boy off, but she still had work to do. Once again heaving out the chest, Muirin first added another tally to the end of her marks with the dagger, three hundred and thirteen now, and then dug through the coins to find the map.\r\nRolling it out on the floor, it presented the local area. The forests, the coastlines, and most importantly, the other villages and towns that could be reached by a few days on the road. Of course, Muirin needed somewhere along the coast, so she could keep her eyes and ears on the sea, but there were plenty of villages north. The further the better, but it would be a costly trip.\r\nCounting out her coins, she found that she still had a favourable amount, but not nearly as much as she would’ve liked. A new cottage would be costly, supplies would be costly, money was needed for bribes and then there was the matter of living a comfortable life thereafter. Here, she had more than enough to sit well into the end of her days, but elsewhere she’d need a greater savings.\r\nThe bag was still lying in the forest, unmoved and unharmed. Apart from the widow and the former farmer who had moved along that path every day, she was sure no one would find it but by chance, like her. It had been tempting to bring the sack with her, but in broad daylight it would rouse too much suspicion. She needed to be careful with it. Especially with Tayv’s eyes everywhere and her reaching greedy fingers. Still, the solution might lie in that assortment of strange items that Muirin was sure could be magical.\r\nMuirin would need to be smart, especially with two young children to carry, she would need to come up with a plan.\r\n\r\nThe strange bag in the woods could wait while she made the preparations. The widow was dead and buried, but she didn’t trust life enough to keep the body hidden, and if that were to happen, she wanted to be well away from the town. Muirin knew that no one would care enough to track her down, especially with Tayv watching them, but they would be hunting for a quick justice in the borders of the town’s region. Muirin couldn’t be here for that.\r\nIt was a firm leash by which Tayv controlled the town. The witch, as that’s what Muirin had always thought of her, was determined to keep the townsfolk inside and working. It was the only way to ensure a healthy stream of coin towards her waiting fingers, as well as crops and whatever else of value the villagers had. Of course, to keep the coin coming, there needed to be trade, and for trade that meant people had to be able to come and go as they needed.\r\nThe merchants were about the only people that benefited in the town, as when the month came to its end, and that wretched bell rung out, they could be miles away planning their next meal. For every other villager though, they were stuck here. Tayv made sure of that. Guards inspected everything coming in and out of the town and were even diligent enough to create comprehensive lists that were check and rechecked when the merchants moved through the gates. Smuggling people, no matter how much they paid, was difficult, but smuggling something else was a lot simpler.\r\nIt had been rumoured, although if true Muirin couldn’t be sure, that there was some enchantment on the people here that allowed Tayv to track them down if they did escape. That would be another problem to consider on another day though, if indeed it was true, right now Muirin was only in need of a merchant.\r\nThe merchant was about a foot taller than her, and three feet wider, he carried himself as if he was always on the verge of bursting into a giggling fit, and kept himself warm in a ghastly green cloak that had seen far too much of the road. Muirin knew him well, but he had never seen fit to give his name, which was understandable, as any sordid business in the village was usually done through him. She approached his stall, leading her two children by the arm, and tried her best to blend in. Today it was a bread stall, last week it was fish, next week it’ll be something else.\r\n‘Ah, now tis a fine day,’ he said, arms wide. ‘I was gettin’ ta wonderin’ if you’d gimme the pleasure a callin’ for me, Muirin my lady.’\r\n‘I need something from you.’ Muirin whispered it straight to the point, while gently sliding over a small bag of coins, one she had gathered that very hour. ‘I’ve procured some special items and I need you to reach out to one of my contacts.’\r\n‘This ain’t a friendly call then?’ The merchant took the coins and briefly looked inside, then sighed with something of an exaggerated grimace. The burly gentleman pushed the coins back. ‘Not enough.’\r\n‘Not enough?’\r\n‘I’d barely be outta town before I’d spent it,’ he said. ‘Prices go up, my costs go up, just good business.’\r\n‘How much?’\r\n‘Well, another bag like that one ought to do it.’\r\n‘Fine.’ Muirin thrust the bag back over. ‘Take half now then and I’ll bring the other half tomorrow.’\r\n\r\nPART 1/2 !!\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

She knew of one person, and no more than that, in the surrounding areas that might both know about these strange items and be interested in buying them. A man on the outskirts of two towns over that made a modest living selling weapons. Muirin had met him before, many times, all on occasions when she had a need to sell things quickly. They both knew a coded language, as was the way, and this was how her note was written. In it, she had described what she had found, even going as far to list the individual items with modest descriptions, and what she think they might be worth.\r\nThe merchant took a look at the note, which would appear meek in his eyes, and slid it into his pocket. ‘I’ll see it done, if ya get me one more bag.’\r\n‘I will,’ she promised.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Muirin had relied on the kindness of a stranger to look after her children as she made another foray into the woods. Again, they had been left to play with the baker’s own children, and she knew they would be well looked after until her return, which shouldn’t be more than a couple of hours later. The day was still bright, just past midday, and she’d marched off at about this time purposefully to keep within the sun’s light.\r\nIt wasn’t difficult to find the strange bag of treasures in the woods. Muirin slid, more than fell, down the bank this time and discovered them exactly where she had found them. Sighing with something of relief for fear of the bag being found, she brought a rope to it and fastened it tight. The rope, something she had brought hidden in a sack of her own, was tied to a tree at the top of the bank and would provide the right leverage for the sack to be lifted without outright relying on her tired strength.\r\nAs she pulled, she once again thought about the collection and how it had come to lie here. The most reasonable explanation she could muster was that someone must have dropped it here along the path above. The why of that though was difficult to comprehend. Perhaps it was a stranger on the run, which seemed likely, a thief who had thought to drop off the bag of loot before they were caught with it. Little good that would do them around here with laws not stretching further than a town’s boundaries.\r\nInside, on the second glance, she had found both plate mail and a heavy looking set of greaves that seemed to radiate with holy light. Two items that, on their own, would make the bag impossible to lift, even with the aid of a pulley. Yet here she was, lifting it. They must be magical then, was her only thought on the matter, to be as light as they were now. It probably wouldn’t be a hard task to get them home either, especially if she made her way there through the beach.\r\nShe had opted for the daylight over the night, as if she were found carrying the sack in the darkness, that would do nothing but rouse suspicion. At least in the day, coming from the woods she had once frequented, it might look a little more innocent.\r\nOnce satisfied that the dragging bag was sitting comfortably at the top of the bank, Muirin decided to go and join it.\r\nSomething was waiting for her at the top though, sitting on the edge of the bank and tentatively sniffing at the bag. Muirin saw the fir first before she knew the creature by name. It was a brown bear, a resident of the woods no doubt, and it was sitting lazily near the bag as if it thought there might be food inside. Not daring to move an inch, for fear of stirring the creature, Muirin kept her hold on the rope and hovered just a little below the creature’s eyeline.\r\nIt was a curious animal. It would paw at the bag, every now and then, as if trying to guess what was inside. The minutes though paced on, and Muirin was beginning to grow more anxious about the time. The bear and the bag were sat right off the path. Any stranger walking by would have a hard time not seeing them.\r\nSuddenly, as if encouraged into motion, the bear took the bag up in its maw and began moving further into the woods. With no other choice, Muirin forced herself up and towards it. There she started shouting obscenities, screaming towards the thing, and it became confused. The bear arched its back like a scared dog, looking around for something that could explain why this fearful woman had appeared.\r\nMuirin casts her arms wide, trying to make herself as large as possible.\r\nThis though seemed only to agitate the bear. It dropped the bag from its mouth and stood to its full height. There came a roar then, a deep bellied roar that would strip the skin from a stranger, but Muirin stood taller against it. She roared back, though not as loud, but enough to make the creature question her.\r\nIt came upon her, and she had no choice but to run. Fortunately enough, she had a good spot to run to. Muirin backtracked towards the sloping bank, rushing towards it, as the bear paced after her on all fours. She slipped down and the creature slipped after her. Then, in the way each villager is taught from a young age, she ran down the slope while crossing over her feet, moving over one way and then the other, trying to cause the bear to spill.\r\nThe wild bear tripped over its clumsy feet and fell forward into a roll. It was exactly as Muirin had hoped, but there was something wrong. She had failed to estimate her own position and found herself running in the path of the sudden furry boulder. In her younger days, she could have simply dodged to the left, roll out of the way, and probably laugh at the asinine bear as it slammed into a tree. These days though were different. In trying to jump out of the way she felt her left ankle twist in a painful way, not enough to sprain, but enough to lose her precious seconds.\r\nThe pair tumbled together.\r\nMuirin hit the ground first and the bear tumbled after her. They both landed within ten feet of one another, each groggy in the head and slow to realise what had happened. Luckily, it was Muirin that came to her height first, pulling out the dagger and eyeing the bear very, very carefully. The creature came to next and gave her an equal gaze of contempt. She stared at it, and it stared at her. There’d be nowhere to run, not now they were in the thickets. If the bear chose to fight her, Muirin would have no choice but to do the same.\r\nThere was a moment of silence between the pair as calculations were made and muscles were braced.\r\nThe bear charged first, drawing to its full height and striking out at Muirin. Three dagger-like claws dug into the side of her head and sent her to the ground. It was like getting hit round the head by a boxer on their best day, the strike knocked the sense from her, made the world dizzy and blurred, and left her with just enough reason to brace herself after she hit the floor.\r\nMuirin brought the dagger up, knowing what would happen next. Her head was bleeding, it was coming down into her eyes, and the bear had finally decided that she wasn’t a threat, no, she was a meal. It pounced on her, maw first, and Muirin brought the dagger down.\r\nMen, woman, bears, they all could die the same ways. The point of the dagger went into the bear’s eye first, then penetrated right through to the creature’s brain. It let out a wounded howl and retreated a little back. Muirin had the sense of mind to pull the dagger with her hand as it moved away. It’s not that easily to kill a bear though, and even more enraged now, it came back upon her.\r\nMuirin brought the dagger through the other eye, which both stunned and blinded the beast. She had just enough mind left to bring the dagger to the creature for a final blow. This time through its thick skull. The dagger didn’t do much though, it couldn’t pierce the bone of the thing, and simply bounced off. It flew from her hand and into the wilderness around them. The right damage had been done though regardless. A moment after the dagger had disappear, the creature slumped and found its way on top of her.\r\nUnder the weight of the dying bear, Muirin allowed her injuries to guide her into unconsciousness, sure that in addition to the blow on her head and the cuts on her face, the bear had just broken a few of ribs when it collapsed on top of her.\r\n\r\nIt was night when she finally opened her eyes. She couldn’t see much of it through the trees, but the shadows were enough for her to be sure of the fact.\r\nThe bear was dead, but she was far from danger. Every inhale of breath was accompanied with a sharp pain in her chest, it hurt to breath, squashed underneath this thing, and her head was thumping like a hammer against an old board.\r\nUsing her hands to help move the dirt around her, Muirin managed to pull herself out from underneath the beast. She stared at it once before struggling back up the slope. It seemed smaller than the thing she had fought somehow, more a baby than a bear. Grimacing, with her lips tightening into a thin line, she whispered, ‘Three hundred and fourteen.’\r\nThe bag was miraculously still waiting for her at the top of the slope, but the combination of night and the rasping of her breath would need to change her plans completely. Muirin couldn’t carry the bag, not in its entirety, and she had to be very careful heading back to the village so as not to be seen either. Then there were her children. Whatever would they be thinking now with their mother gone so long? They’d be sick with worry, although she was sure that they were still safe with the baker. The baker was good like that.\r\nThe bag would need to be taken in multiple trips, she decided reluctantly, and perhaps the next trip would need to be a few days away. Muirin’s chest was in shambles and her head was still buzzing from the bear’s mighty blow. Not to mention the blood now soaking her dress. She’d just have to risk the rest of the bag’s contents being discovered.\r\nFrom the assortment of items, she took the lighter items, which included a strange hood, a ring, a necklace, a sash, and finally the falchion, which she wove into the belt of her dress. Muirin kicked the rest of the bag down the bank, hoping it would roll far enough not to be seen by strangers, and then steadily made her way back.\r\nShe found a large branch and fashioned it in a crutch, which she leaned on for the rest of her journey. It took her an hour to move through from the woods to the comforting sight of the sea and the sand. The sea air seemed to soothe her somewhat, but it was still a while to her cottage over the treacherous rocks.\r\n\r\nMuirin didn’t go to her children. She found she couldn’t. They were safe enough, she reasoned, and she needed a moment to rest and to clean herself. Just as soon as the items were pushed beneath her bed, just as soon as the bloody gashes down her face were stitched, just as soon as her dress was off and thrown into a bucket of water, she allowed herself to fall into the folds of her welcoming bed and sleep.\r\n\r\nThere had been ten men with her, she remembered, and not one of them had brought a present. They had gathered about in her quarters, her most loyal servants, but they had guessed ahead of time what she was going to tell them. That’s why she was taken aback by their reluctance to bring a gift. It felt appropriate they bring a gift. Muirin couldn’t remember what had been said, but she could remember the swaying of the ship, mixed with the fresh sea air, and the sounds of the lapping waves against the bow. It was a good time to be on the sea, but a better time to leave it for the news.\r\n\r\nMuirin woke with a start and breathed through the pain of her chest. She winced. The ribs were definitely broken and seemed unsettled. She found that she couldn’t breathe deeply without letting out a groan of pain, which meant the bones were digging into her lungs. Or at least she reasoned they were. She’d have to take it slow and make sure she bandaged the area well, which she did shortly after rising, and keep as much heat there as possible to ease the pain.\r\nWith a struggle, as she found herself so weak now, Muirin placed herself in another dress and made sure she was presentable. Her wounds were still bleeding, she’d never been very good at dressing wounds, but she found that a change in her cloth bandages were enough to quell it for now. She’d need the right stinging ointment.\r\nWithout even struggling through her breakfast, Muirin anxiously paced towards the baker’s house, just a little down the row, so she could retrieve her children.\r\nThere was a darkness on the village today, she saw, in the form of storm clouds on the horizon. There was something else too. Something old, but familiar. Suddenly she was picking up her pace and rushing to the bakers. Muirin hurried past the intoxicating aroma of new loafs, still in the oven, and pastry goods, and rushed inside of the house attached to the shop front.\r\nShe was met with an empty home. Muirin called after her children, sudden fear rising in her gut, but there was no answer. Not even the baker, who should be spending the morning preparing the meals, or even her children, answered their names when called. There was something in this, Muirin realised, but she didn’t know it for what it was until she checked the back door.\r\nA note was stuck to it with a dagger.\r\nThe dagger was bloody and was hers.\r\nThe note was familiar, scribbled in her own handwriting, and written in a code.\r\n\r\nThe bell rang shortly after, calling the villagers to the square. For the most part, Muirin ignored it, instead electing to go back to her home and keeping a careful watch over her back. At about the last twist of the road before she came to her cottage, she saw him, peering out from around the corner. The man who had been following her. How she hadn’t noticed him before she could only ascribe to her being sloppy.\r\nKeeping natural, Muirin entered her home, ignoring the still ringing bell, and went straight for her room. There she thought for a moment on where she’d choose to hide if needing the choice. Quietly, she reached under the bed, wincing at the pain it did her, and pulled out the falchion. She examined it only for a second before, just as quietly, climbing out of her bedroom window.\r\nShe found him lurking around the corner, his eyes were square on the front door with no clue as to her approach. When she pushed the tip of the blade into the small of his back, he let out a short yelp before raising his hands like a sheepish child caught in the act of something vile but innocent. He was a tall man, gaunt, with fading hair and a smell of putrid onions. It was a wonder she hadn’t noticed him before.\r\n‘You’ve been following me.’\r\n‘I was told to,’ came his reply. ‘She told me to.’\r\n‘Why?’ Muirin asked. ‘Why me and why now?’\r\n‘The farmer’s widow went to her, told her about you.’\r\n‘What about me?’\r\n‘About your former life.’ He shrugged. ‘She thought the widow was desperate, wanted proof, but had me follow you to make sure.’\r\n‘The widow met me in my house, and I killed her.’\r\n‘I know, I saw you bury her.’\r\n‘Why did nothing come of this then?’ Muirin teased the blade in a little more. ‘When you had a reason to suspect me?’\r\n‘I told her, I did, but she said it was fair,’ replied the man. ‘The widow had gone to you, no doubt to cause trouble, and you’d killed her out of justice. She wanted me to keep an eye on you, to see what you would do next.’\r\n‘You followed me into the markets, didn’t you?’ said Muirin. ‘You saw me hand the note to the merchant.’\r\n‘He was easy to get the note off, when you didn’t show up with the rest of his marks.’\r\n‘You got the note after then,’ Muirin realised quietly. ‘And then you followed me into the woods.’\r\n‘I saw your horde of items; you must’ve been squirreling those away for years.’ He turned then, slowly, so as not to awake her falchion’s anger. He had something of venom in his voice. ‘It’s true, ain’t it? No one has a horde like that except for—’\r\nIn one swift motion the falchion met his throat, strangling the next words from out of his mouth. Muirin, with no sense of sympathy, moved past him as he struggled and fell to his knees, all the while trying to hold back the tide of blood.\r\n‘Three hundred and fifteen,’ she said as she wiped the blood of the blade. Muirin turned her attention back to the village, she knew exactly where she would find children now.\r\n\r\nThere was no line of villagers patiently waiting to pay the tithing. The local guards had moved them all aside, so that the street was clear for Muirin’s entrance. She came like a legend, the sea at her back, taking each step without a single betrayal of her true condition. The village green was ahead of her, and although none of the villagers truly knew the circumstances, they seemed to know it revolved around her. They were, after all, the ones that had shared the rumours.\r\nMuirin saw them and knew them. Each of them. There was the baker, whose children played with her children. The merchant, who sheepishly looked away from her. A man she had sold apples to in the market. A teacher who taught her children. A woman who had sold her the dresses she wore every day. Men who had helped to build her cottage. A community of people that she had come to know over the last decade of her time in the village. All of them, living for the past few years, under the thumb of a cruel hag who wouldn’t even let them flee from their predicament. Not even send a note.\r\nTayv was waiting in the village green on her gnarled throne, a grin sprawled between her ears.\r\n‘How did you manage to escape my notice?’ She said to herself, leaning forward with interested as Muirin entered the green. It was empty, except for the two of them, unless of course you counted the many statues still frozen in place as recompense for past debts. ‘How have you avoided recognition for so long?’\r\n‘It doesn’t matter,’ Muirin replied, pointing her falchion squarely towards her. ‘Where are my children?’\r\n‘You’re not looking too good.’ Tayv stood up from her throne, moved a few graceful steps towards her. She moved rather like a puppet that had lost its strings, it was unnerving to watch her. ‘Do you think you have the strength for this?’\r\n‘You know who I am,’ replied Muirin. ‘Or at least know what I am.’\r\n‘I’m starting to believe it,’ said Tayv. ‘Where do we go from here?’\r\n‘Where are my children?’\r\nTayv clicked her fingers. Only once, but that proved to be more than enough. A guard stepped forward and revealed her boy and her girl, both tied up with rope and kept on leashes like dogs. They looked scared, Muirin noticed, they had been crying. Her falchion wavered a little. Tayv approached closer, a matter of six steps away now.\r\n‘Should I turn them to stone first?’ She asked, politely. ‘Or I guess what I’m really asking is this, would you like to watch or be watched?’\r\n‘Neither.’ The falchion dropped to the floor with a rattling clang. Muirin went down to her knees slowly but shortly after. ‘I’d prefer to make a deal.’\r\n‘A deal?’ Tayv half-laughed, almost a cackle. ‘From what I’ve heard about you, you don’t make deals.’\r\n‘Times change.’ Muirin took a deep breath. ‘Turn me to stone and let them go. I’ll go without a fight.’\r\n‘Now, isn’t that interesting?’ Tayv came closer, even beginning to pace around her like a tiger on the prowl. ‘Has motherhood really changed that much? I’ve heard things about you that make even my stomach turn. The things you’ve done for gold and treasure go beyond what earns a person an eternity below.’\r\n‘Please, just spare the children, they can’t do anything against you.’\r\n‘I’m touched.’ Tayv reached out her hand towards Muirin and she didn’t struggle against it. Her creeping fingers burned, like a scorching hot pan against her skin, and she fought the urge to shriek. Instead, Muirin shouted, screamed, towards her, as her skin began to stiffen and crack like worn stone. ‘SWEAR IT!’\r\n‘No.’\r\nWithout a sense of hesitation nor intention to succumb to the burning sensation writhing across her skin, Muirin took a hold of the falchion before her knees and still within reach. It all came down to speed in the end and she found herself drawing on a past life then. Her muscles, though aching, remembered her years spent swinging the sword in a flash and a flurry. Of killing hundreds before they even knew what had happened.\r\nTayv had seen the deception but had little time to dodge it. The falchion went up and through her chest as easily as a knife through butter. It all happened in the instance of a second and the stone veil followed after it. It crept up Muirin’s skin, flowed across the blade of the sword, and into the witch that had first summoned it.

She knocked over a clutch of emeralds, scrabbling behind the shelf for the telltale prick of the Crown. Instead, her fingers came back dusty and glinting. Frustration poured out of her before she could rein it in. A sudden cacophony squeaks and screeches and then-\r\nThe lifeless bodies of an owl, crow and raven thumped to the vault floor. Elsewhere she could sense rat bodies floating among the piles of gold and spiders hanging dead off of half-finished cobwebs.\r\n\r\nBreathe. Just breathe through it.\r\n\r\nShe took in lungfuls of dusty, slightly metallic air and contemplated the corpses. Her magic felt volatile, malevolent. It was hot, frenzied and rubbed her insides raw. This had never happened before. Again, the helplessness and rage bubbled up in her and as before it flung out tearing through the corpses. Feathers fluttered through the air as heads rolled one way and bodies dismembered itself. Blood and guts spewed across the floor and splashed onto her face. She grit her teeth, adamant to gain control without the wand or the crown. This was a process she enjoyed. This was her craft for fuck’s sake.\r\n\r\nHer knuckles grew white as she clenched them and sweat pooled at the back of her neck. Her magic extended further than the vault and an unfortunate maid shriveled into husk. She grappled with herself as the kill released something sweet, potent, heady within her. Maybe it’d be best to let go…lovely skeletons to play with. As her thoughts wavered her magic became compliant with almost cat-like coyness. It flowed through her gently, almost lifting her off her feet.\r\n\r\nThe Wand in its leather holster around her arm grew hot and visions of a smoking, bloodied wasteland enveloped her mind. She almost whimpered at its brutal beauty. The flesh stuck to battlements and wood, blood splattered across walls and grass like large landscape paintings. She wanted that. Wanted to be the catalyst of that. The reason for that.\r\n\r\nThe edges of her vision turned black, she could feel the imminent explosion of her power. But just as she let go of all control the door to the vault banged open and there was a sudden pressure in her head.\r\n\r\nFuck. The Elders.\r\n\r\nAnd she collapsed, covered in blood, reeking of Vitriol.\r\n\r\nUNREST\r\n\r\nHer head throbbed like it had been trampled on by those ill-fated elephant chimaeras. Her throat was dry and there was a faint taste of blood and smoke in her mouth.\r\n\r\n‘You need not pretend Violette, I know you are awake,’ said a familiar voice.\r\n\r\nThat’s not my name. My name was lost to this façade you made me put up.\r\n\r\nShe groaned and opened her eyes. Sunlight filtered through grey and black gauzy currents dappled on the floor of her chambers. She was tucked into a nest of plump pillows and thick wool blankets in the middle of her bed.\r\n\r\nElder Morgana stood facing the direction of the town, her back tensed.\r\n\r\nThis is why she liked her dungeon. Nobody dared enter. They thought Death lingered. Idiots.\r\n\r\n‘You failed to mention the Crown was no longer in your possession at the last Coven gathering,’ said Elder Morgana, still not deigning to look at her.\r\n\r\nShe rolled her eyes. ‘I didn’t know it wasn’t in my possession at the last Coven meeting.’\r\n\r\n‘Unacceptable. Violette, you know the power you can wield. The credibility and respect it gives us as a Coven that practices Vitriol. You cannot be flippant about the relics of your destiny,’ said Elder Morgana, finally turning around.\r\n\r\nViolette saw black again. Rage was a live thing within her.\r\n\r\n‘You are right. I know the power I wield. You don’t talk to me that way. I am your Queen,’ she said, though her voice shook. She had never stood up to one of them, not once in all the time she’d known them.\r\n\r\nElder Morgana laughed. A high, cold sound and her expression shifted to one of mirth. The temperature in the room dropped a few degrees.\r\n\r\n‘Child. You may have untold power but you are young. Volatile, with little to no control as evidenced by the events at the vault. I, on the other hand, have the strength of a Coven and the wisdom of time long forgotten.’\r\n\r\nThe pressure in her head was back, the room became frigid and the light turned a cold, murky blue.\r\n\r\nShe gasped as Elder Morgana stalked forward and grabbed her hand with icy fingers. The Ring was forced down her finger and her mind was enveloped in sudden calm. Her magic, however, felt like it was being throttled.\r\n\r\nShe squirmed out of the grasp and tried to remove the ring. It wouldn’t budge. Her magic wailed but her mind willed her to scream quietly.\r\n\r\n‘Wha…wha…,’ she started. Swallowed and tried again. ‘What is this?’\r\n\r\nElder Morgana sat beside her and stroked her cheek. Unwillingly, she turned towards the palm as the light went back to muted yellow and Elder Morgana murmured ‘ It is a suppressor layered over the Ring’s existing power. It is temporary, only until we find out how to help you learn control or we find the Crown. Whichever comes first. Orwina here is the caster of the suppressor and will be here to monitor its effects on you.’\r\n\r\nA figure she had not previously noticed, stepped out from the shadows near her wardrobe and curtsied. ‘Your grace.’\r\n\r\nHer power reared and cut through her to no avail. She screamed, long and loud.\r\n\r\nYou puny, insignificant creature be the watcher, warden of my power, my person? Never. I shall find a way out of this. I shall not tolerate disrespect like this. I am Vitriol personified. I shall bathe in the blood of the Coven if I have to. But I shall be no caged beast.\r\n\r\nUNHINGED\r\n\r\nIt had been twelve days since her imprisonment. Oh, they didn’t call it that. They called it ‘care’ and ‘rest’. Her chimaeras were handed off to lesser witches to finish while she ‘recovered’.\r\n\r\nBut she knew what this truly was. Fear. They were scared of what her power could do. As they should be but they counted on her affections for them to keep her at bay while they found a way to control her. The signs were there.\r\n\r\nOrwina came everyday without fail at dawn, dusk and the witching hour to take measure of her. True to her purpose, Orwina constantly maintained the suppressor without it causing any harm but she also performed a multitude of spells that Violette for the life of her couldn’t determine.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be done. The Ring could calm her but her magic grew restless and tired. It needed to be let out. It needed to cause harm, maim, torture, kill.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth day a thought struck her. She almost laughed out loud. How had she not realized this before?\r\n\r\nWhen Orwina entered her bedchambers at the witching hour it was to find an unusually cheerful Violette.\r\n\r\n‘Everything alright, your grace?’ asked Orwina, curtsying.\r\n\r\n‘Sensational, Orwina,’ she replied, a smile stretching across her face.\r\n\r\nIf Orwina felt the back of her neck prick in warning, she didn’t show it. Instead, concentrated on finishing her work.\r\n\r\n‘Orwina, did you know that a witch’s spells are tied to herself?’ asked Violette. And continued without waiting for a response, ‘ For example, if I wasn’t so careful myself, my chimaeras could be easily undone by something as silly as a little of my blood spilled. Imagine that! Any do-gooder could achieve that then, if they put their mind to it of course.’\r\n\r\nOrwina, surprised at the chatting Queen, shook her head. ‘No your grace. It wouldn’t be that simple. For your creations to fail in that case, they would have to kill you or very nearly ki…’\r\nThe blood drained out of Orwina’s face.\r\n\r\nViolette just smiled prettily up at her. Unmoving.\r\n\r\nOrwina tried to get up from her perch next to the Queen. She found she couldn’t move.\r\n\r\n‘Just a little paralysis inducing poison I had lying around,’ said Violette conversationally.\r\n\r\n‘You wouldn’t. You can’t. I control your magic,’ whispered Orwina as she tried to lift her hands to cast.\r\n\r\n‘See? That is what you lack. Imagination,’ said Violette getting up. ‘Who told us the only way to kill is through Vitriol? Knives work just fine, Orwina.’\r\n\r\n‘You can’t! It is forbidden! You mustn’t kill another witch from your Coven!’ said Orwina, tears flowing down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n‘Now, now Orwina. You must know I don’t like the word forbidden. I cavort with Death itself. What are these rules of mere mortals to me?’ said Violette, a sharp knife caressed lovingly. ‘Did you know that every death adds to my power? True, I used only my magic till now but my Wand calls out to me, assuring me it works fine without using magic as well.’\r\n\r\nViolette slowly brought the knife to Orwina’s throat. She could feel it tremble, the pulse fluctuating wildly. Her own pulsed in response. She was almost light-headed with excitement. She closed her eyes, readying.\r\n\r\n‘You are a vile creature much like one of your creations, you know that?’ spat Orwina. ‘ You will never know true contentment in this life. Always searching for things, bigger and better. You will be lost in yourself. And if I must die, I am glad that my last words to you will be: I am the one that stole the Crown.’\r\n\r\nViolette blinked open her eyes and examined her victim. So the Crown was indeed missing. She shrugged, it didn’t matter to her one way or the other. It was the Elders that insisted all the relics be together. All she wanted was her Grave Wand back.\r\n\r\nViolette laughed. ‘True contentment? Do you hear yourself? Contentment was never in the stars for us. We are Demon-witches of Vitriol. We sow sorrow and wreak havoc. That is our purpose and joy. That is all. About the Crown, I don’t care but my creations are art, you worthless worm!’\r\n\r\nViolette slit Orwina’s throat in one. Warm blood surged down her hands and the giddy, gleeful feeling intensified. Simultaneously, she felt her magic burst out of her, free from its shackles.\r\n\r\nNow, to make art.\r\n\r\nUNQUENCHABLE\r\n\r\nElder Morgana came as soon as she heard the commotion. Orwina hung fused to a dreadworm, eyes gouged, arms and legs grotesquely positioned.\r\n\r\nViolette sat in front of the creation, drenched in blood. She was humming, an animation spell it would seem. Her magic thrummed, smelling vaguely of blood and smoke.\r\n\r\n‘What is the meaning of this Violette?!,’ said Elder Morgana, straining to keep the tremor out of her voice. It would not do to give the child more power.\r\n\r\n‘I thought that was rather obvious, Elder Morgana,’ said Violette. ‘But if you want to be dense about it, I’ll explain. In a few minutes, I will awaken this creation of mine. It is, however, not for sale. It is to be a guardian of mine and a warning to you and the coven. I am happy to do your bidding and work for the good of the Vitriol but you have no power over me. And if someone, anyone dares question that, well…bloodlust, once awakened, is rather hard to quench.’\r\n\r\nElder Morgana looked at what she had helped in creating. It stood blinking serenely at her, covered in guts, blood and brain matter. She would scream monster…but who would she point to? Herself or Violette?",
    "\r\nGenesis Scrolls Round 1: {A cruel fate}\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nMay 2022\r\nMay 2022\r\n\r\n0xStax\r\n\r\n1\r\nMay '22\r\nName/Pseudonym:{ 0xStax }\r\nContact Info: { Twitter: @0xStaxRO, e-mail: 0xstax@gmail.com}\r\nEthereum Wallet Address: {0x446e8C0af98A03CCC7ce4Af821362b281e787b47}\r\n\r\nA cruel fate\r\nLeilen was a shared mythology, an idyllic past that I never lived but that I remembered all the same. It was the smells of a childhood that I didn’t enjoy and the laughter of the brothers that I never met. It was a common history of the things that I knew, and all the things that I didn’t know. For me, Leilen was my past, present and future, it was all I knew and all I needed to know. See, Leilen was an ideal that never truly existed, but it didn’t need to. I was a romantic; we were all romantics back then.\r\n\r\nWe signed up for the war together, on the same day, at the same place. He was the first in line and although it was my idea, I was the last one to sign my name in ink. It had been three years since the war started and everyone was tired. The boys who weren’t killed were now grown men, but you wouldn’t think so when you looked at them. Some had barely grown any hair and a few others hadn’t even started to grow, yet they had spilled more blood in a few days than their grandfathers did in a lifetime. Mothers, sisters, brothers, fathers, cousins. Leilen demanded sacrifice from all. Leilen is a generous land, but a thirsty one as well, and it would drink from the blood of its children until its belly was full and her thirst was quenched.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had served, my father as well, and when it was my time, I felt the call of Leilen deep within my blood, urging me to join the crimson banners. But I was weak and afraid. That’s why I spent one week convincing Bellwin to join.\r\n\r\nBellwin was strong, Bellwin was agile, and he was fast. He would make a great soldier, but more than that, Bellwin was my friend. He would be there to comfort me if I would cry at night. He would be there when I would be so exhausted from the strain, that I wouldn’t be able to stand up. He would be my laughter and joy. He would be the strength inside of me that I wouldn’t have. He would be a piece of home, he would be my talisman, my protector, and guardian, but more than anything, Bellwin would be there. I needed Bellwin more than he needed me. No. He didn’t need me. He was strong and fast, he didn’t need anyone, but he didn’t feel the call of Leilen in his blood. His uncle hadn’t served, his father hadn’t served, and his mother would rather keep him by her side for all eternity instead of relinquish him to the jealous embrace of our thirsty land.\r\n\r\nI spent one week following him, clinging to him like a remora does to old ships. He was a good man, which I think is why he never blew me off. For seven days and seven nights I pestered him. Every day I would perform the same routine, I would visit his house first thing in the morning and knock three times at the door, his mother always answered, I would ask if Bellwin was home and she would close the door, and cry “Your friend is here” in her unmistakable lowland accent. For seven days I woke at dawn, ate breakfast, went to their house and waited patiently for Bellwin’s mother to open the door and command him to meet me.\r\n\r\nI first tried to convince Bellwin using stale rhetoric and images of a distant past that probably never existed but for the fantasy that lived in my mind. I tried to appeal to his sense of duty (trying is the key word, for I am sure that not even I believed my own words) and I exaggerated the atrocities committed against us and downplayed the ones we inflicted. I talked about everything and nothing, I only wanted my friend to join me in a cause that I did not understand but felt obliged to join. It was in the evening of the seventh day that Bellwin accepted. By then I had almost given up hope that Bellwin would join and we had spent the day remembering our early childhood, and thinking about the days before the war. We were sitting atop a small hill overlooking the big valley below, when he told me he had made a decision. He looked down to the river and without looking up he said “Be honest Arthur, do you think we will make it back?”\r\n\r\n“I would like to think so” I said, but I knew that the chances were that we wouldn’t. He laughed and looked up at the sky and told me “I think you are lying, but you are either convinced this is the right thing or you really do believe we will make it back. Either way it would be better dying doing what’s right than living with the guilt of having avoided that choice.” He could see straight through my lies, and yet, he accepted to join.\r\n\r\nWe signed up the next day, and got assigned to the fourth land brigade. We thought it was a good assignment, because the fourth land brigade had never been deployed to any front in three years. However, a week after our training ended we got our orders: we were to join the third army in the west.\r\nThe western part of Leilen was mostly empty, it used to be a lush floodplain, fertile and full of life, but centuries of overgrazing, erosion and war had left it a barren wasteland. Its only use now was as a natural defense against any invading force foolish enough to dare cross it. We survived the desert march at Anarat and joined the third army as they advanced through the pillar of Jarat. I can’t imagine we were what General Lammond, the leader of the third army, expected when he was granted his reinforcement request, but a brigade of starving children was better than zero brigades of starving children. Anarat was an open tomb. Life itself gave up once the sandhills to the south turned to rocks, dunes and dust. The plateau’s only permanent inhabitants were the bleached stones that marked the way for the caravans, and sometimes for the armies.\r\n\r\nWe were told that the third army had been deployed to cut off any potential access to supply routes and protect the western flank from a potential surprise attack across the sandhills. We were to provide additional support to their rear so that they wouldn’t be vulnerable in case the Salrican cavalry decided to show up. When we met with them it appeared as if we were the army and they our reinforcements.\r\n\r\nOur brigade leader was a man called Batista, he was a stern man, but a good soldier, he was the most impacted by the state in which the third army was when we arrived there. Most of us had never seen combat in our lives, and we had never seen what a field army looked like, but Batista was a veteran and he had served with the first army in is youth. When we had left three weeks before, we were told that we were going to join a large defensive force protecting our west flank. Once we got there however, it was obvious they were too few of them, even unexperienced recruits like us knew they were hardly enough to even fake a stand against a direct push.\r\n\r\nThat night we unpacked and set up our camp. After we were settled, the brigadier took me, Bellwin and three others with him and we headed over to general Lammond’s quarters. I can only imagine that the brigadier was in dire need of answers, any answer and he wouldn’t wait until dawn. The general welcomed us, and let us join him in his tent, he invited us to join him at dinner and he looked happy enough to see us, but the brigadier wasn’t one to waste time. Batista immediately asked Lammond if the army had separated back at the dunes of Anarat, or if they had survived an ambush, he even asked if their soldiers had suffered dysentery or a bad fever outbreak. Lammond was confused by Batista’s questions and he didn’t seem pleased with the brigadier’s tone. “I don’t believe I understand what you are implying, brigadier” was his first answer. “The third army is as complete as the day it left the capital. We have lost three men, good men, but their demise would hardly constitute heavy casualties. We have not been ambushed nor have we been the victims of disease. I don’t understand why you would make such accusations.”\r\n\r\n“This force is no army! It can hardly be considered a defense regiment, how are you going to guard the entry into Jarat with such a meek force? Our own brigade is barely enough to fight more than three divisions. You…we will get massacred if the enemy marches here” Batista replied to the general.\r\n“Yes, we would. But the third army is not a defensive force, brigadier. On the contrary, we are an exploratory one, and we have found our quarry. That is why you are here now. Not to defend the pass”\r\n\r\nBatista was surprised at Lammond’s words. His superiors had clearly lied to him, lied to us and lied to the whole country. The official story was that the third army had been deployed to intercept and fend off the advance of one of the main enemy columns that were heading towards the western pass. They were to guard this chokepoint and use the sandhills as territorial advantage. That is why they weren’t in the frontlines fighting with the rest of the forces, they were guarding our exposed flank. But according to Lammond, that was a lie. The third army was never meant to guard Leilen, and they also weren’t equipped to engage enemy forces. That was abundantly clear when we arrived, as our brigade outnumbered the army two-to-one, even calling them a battalion would have been too kind. This was not an army, and yet we were all told that they were meant to protect us from a surprise attack.\r\nThe general didn’t seem too worried about their lack of troops, and although he was clearly happy to see us, he was not expecting us to provide much of a back-up. He must have sensed the concern in the Brigadier’s voice, because he then told us what the true purpose of the army was.\r\n\r\n“A few months before the war started, our ambassador, ambassador Rayel, heard a rumor about a special regiment that had been sent to the sandhills near Jarat, not far from where we presently stand. According to her sources, this was not a scouting regiment, nor a border guard; instead, she said her informants specifically told her it was full of engineers and sappers. As a precaution, we reinforced the border guard and increased the number of patrols, but nothing ever happened. To this day, the sandhills are as devoid of life as they have been for ages. However, some months after the first battles began, we started to hear stories from returning soldiers, stories that hadn’t been told by those returning from the frontlines before. They were telling stories of supernatural foes in the battlefields. They talked about rabid warriors who would keep fighting even after being stabbed multiple times in their guts, they told stories about sorcerers who could conjure storms in broad daylight and bend thunder, wind, and rain to their command. They even told stories of knights wielding weapons so sharp that they would cut straight through armor, pierce cloth and hack limbs in one fell swoop. We dismissed these stories, we dismissed all of it as old tales and superstition mixed with the fear and agony that only a soldier who has been in the battlefield understands. We kept hearing these stories though. Once we heard them from people returning from different fronts is when we started to worry. We were also losing. A year and a half of fighting and the dead were pilling higher than what we ever expected them to be. Leilen had always thirsted for blood, but this type of butchery was unheard of. We suffered more casualties in the first six months of the war than all our losses in the previous one combined. We were not prepared, and neither were the common folk. We couldn’t keep asking them to send their loved ones to the slaughter like we had before.\r\n\r\nSo, the High Court gave an order. We would retreat from open combat and all enemy combatants were to be taken for interrogation when possible. We hid in open fields and our soldiers turned from honorable warriors to backstabbing thieves and kidnappers, but it was worth it. We stopped our own bleeding and we started to get information. We must have interrogated hundreds if not thousands of Salricans, unfortunately, most of them told us what we wanted to hear, and not what we needed to know. This went on for some months, until last year, when we struck gold. We captured someone that had been part of the same engineer regiment that got sent to the sandhills. After a few hours of interrogation, he told us that the engineer regiment had been sent to the desert to dig for something, he said he himself knew only his own orders, and that every other member of the regiment had been told only what they needed to know as well. According to him, once the regiment had returned from the desert, senior field officers in all parts of the Salrican army had been given new armor and weapons, he said they called them “regalias” and that some of those officers had been sent to fight deep in the lines, directly against our soldiers. He also told us something quite interesting, he said that those regalias were not made by any artisans, but that they were found.\r\n\r\nThat engineer regiment had been sent to the desert to dig, and what they found were these “regalias”. We didn’t know if the regalias were connected to the stories our soldiers were telling, but the timeline was relatively close to when we first started hearing the stories, and if they believed that digging in the desert was worth it, we needed to keep up with them. We still don’t know why the engineer regiment stopped their work, our prisoner only said that they received orders to return after they sent the first set of regalias back and that was it. That is how the third army came to be. We were created for the sole purpose of finding out what was hidden here, in the desert. We were tasked to find whatever it was the Salrican engineers found and if there was anything left, something they didn’t find, recover it and take it back to Leilen. We couldn’t justify diverting any force away from the frontlines to go on a fool’s errand digging up sand in the desert, it would have been political suicide – so we started to circulate rumors of a western column marching towards the Jarat pass and it gave us the excuse to send a small but specialized force here.\r\n\r\nYou are here because we finally found what was buried beneath the sandhills. We have found our own regalias.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Lammond then took us to a heavily guarded tent in the eastern part of the camp where they had stored the regalias and once we were inside, he showed us what the treasure was. They had found thirty-two sacks, each one had a silken cord that ran along its mouth and allowed it to be closed, and they were all made of velvet. A final flourish of golden thread ran along the mouth of each sack, accentuating their elegance. Eight sacks were dyed in an indigo color, eight more were dyed in emerald, and sixteen sacks were dyed in a crimson shade, an auspicious sign as crimson was the color of Leilen. Each sack contained 8 different items and they appeared to be random in nature, however all sacks contained one weapon, a full set of armor and two pieces of jewelry. All of the items were as pristine as if they had been made that very same day.\r\n\r\nBellwin and I were awe-struck at the beauty of this treasure. I could see that these regalias were rare and powerful beyond measure – although I couldn’t tell you why I felt that way. But I’m sure Bellwin felt the same as I did. I’m sure anyone who placed their eyes on top of the regalias would have felt the same. The craftwork of the armor and the jewelry was unmatched by anything that I had seen in Leilen up to that point. The weapons were certainly far deadlier than our own equipment, and if the enemy had set their hands on something like this, it would explain the stories that Lammond said our troops were telling.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, brigadier Batista and general Lammond discussed what their next step would be and how to best utilize our combined forces. Marching had been difficult, and I wanted to rest, but I was happy that we were not joining a fighting force. Even though the sun never ceased to shine, and the heat was so oppressive that breathing was painful, even though I had been driven to exhaustion more than once, and that the nights were so cold that we had to sleep with our horses to keep us warm, I didn’t have to worry about fighting. I was safe, and Bellwin was still by my side. So if we had to march back across the desert, or if we were going to be running errands instead of fighting, I couldn’t care less. I had fulfilled the obligation demanded by my bloodline, and I had been spared the wrath of our foes. I was not going to be look a gifted horse in the mouth. At noon, Batista and Lammond explained the new orders.\r\n\r\nWe were to take the thirty-two regalias back to the capital and deliver them to the High Court as fast as possible. The whole army would not be marching back as it would take too much time to mobilize all of us, and it could also alert enemy scouts of our discovery; having our combined forces suddenly march back across the desert just forty-eight hours after being reinforced would be too suspicious. Instead, a hand-picked cavalry unit composed of thirty-two riders, one for each sack, and guarded by two guards each for a total of ninety-six riders would ride back and deliver the regalias by hand. Brigadier Batista would lead this unit to the capital, and he himself was supported by four lieutenants as well. The last member to join was the lead engineer of the third army, he was to brief the general command of what they had found and possibly discuss how to further continue their exploration once the war was over. In the end, this special unit consisted of one hundred and two soldiers, and they were to make a journey that took us three weeks, in five days.\r\n\r\nI was not selected to be one of the one hundred and two riders at the beginning, but after Bellwin was chosen, I asked to join him as one of his guards. The brigadier was not convinced I was strong enough to complete the trip in time, but I swore to him that I would not leave Bellwin’s side, and I promised him that he would not be better guarded by anyone else. I was the weakest of the group, that was evident, but Bellwin managed to convince Batista, he said that I was the reason he was there in the first place, and that I had family in a border town so I knew the terrain - this was of course, a lie - which could prove useful in case we needed to change our route or worse, get ambushed.\r\n\r\nAs promised, I never let my eyes off Bellwin for three days straight. The way back to Leilen was as empty as it had been the first time around, the only signs of life were the tracks that we had left before and had not been swept by the wind. We rode as fast as we could for three days straight, we rode until dusk and woke up before dawn, we rested the absolute minimum, and as soon as the horses were awake we edged them on. Even if we didn’t need to make the trip back in five days because of the regalias, our horses would have surely collapsed on the sixth day.\r\n\r\nIt was when we had reached the edges of Anarat that the earth shook.\r\n\r\nThe earth pounded beneath our feet as if it was a massive drumhead. The pounding started slow, loud and severe, and then it grew faster and louder, each beat closer to the next, until the drumming resembled marching steps. The earth vibrated as if an army of giants was marching towards us, it pounded and pounded with such a strength that it scared our horses so much that some of them threw their riders off and they ran into the desert. And then, just as sudden as the beating of the earth had begun, the desert air went still and a humid heat fell upon us. Dark clouds replaced what just a minute before had been arid, cloudless skies.\r\n\r\nWith the thunderclouds came a great sandstorm, and I saw a figure clad in black rise above it. Bellwin then murmured something that chilled me to the bone, “there is no wind” he said. He was right, there was no wind blowing, and yet we could see the desert dunes being shaped like clay and the sandstorm growing larger in front of us. Suddenly, the black figure twisted in an unnatural way, contorting itself like a rag doll and bending its limbs in impossible angles. It hung motionless in the sky for a moment and then it fell back to the earth, plummeting behind the stormdust.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I remember is Bellwin slapping me awake, and the sandstorm raging all around us. Our whole unit had been swallowed by the dust and I could only see what was directly in front of me. Bellwin was next to me and I had grabbed hold of his arm, Loric, Bellwin’s other guard was behind me, and we could hear Batista screaming somewhere in front of us. We were trying to follow Batista’s voice when we got hit by the first volley. An arrow pierced Loric’s shoulder and a few other fell directly in front of my feet. I then heard Batista’s voice grow louder, and then the sound of steel clashing against steel. The sandstorm was too thick for us to see anything, but the fight was loud. I knew they must have been fighting close to us. Loric, Bellwin and I moved into a triangle formation as our training commanded and we drew our swords, ready to face an invisible enemy. We were standing back to back when an arm grabbed my leg and pulled me down into the sand, I fell into one knee and stabbed the ground frantically, trying to kill whatever had dragged me, but as I did, more arms shot through the sand and grabbed hold of me, trying to pull me down into the dunes. Bellwin and Loric ran to me and cut two of the arms clean. I stood back up and prepared for the next attack. Loric kept slashing at the arms and with each slash the sand turned redder and redder, until a scimitar pierced the sandstorm and lodged itself in Loric’s chest.\r\n\r\nAfter Loric was killed, I instinctively sought to guard Bellwin. As I turned to protect him I saw a second scimitar come from the side and slit his throat open. When Bellwin fell, he was still holding his regalia. He had been given one of the crimson sacks, and he had held it with him ever since we left the third army, he said the crimson color was proof that it belonged to Leilen and he never let go of it until his very last moment. When the sack fell to the ground, I felt the very same ground shake. I ducked the next attack and grabbed the regalia as fast as I could. I ran away from the sand ghosts until I couldn’t run anymore. The fighting was raging in all sides, through the thick sand I could hear the screams of the dying, the sound of steel cleaving meat and the splash of the blood in the dry sand. When I finally realized what had happened I cried to the heavens, I cried and begged to any god who would listen to my pain, my anger and my rage.\r\n\r\nI got no answer, no one would listen to my anguish, no one, except Death. She had listened, she had been there since the start, she had taken the sandghosts, she had taken Loric, and Bellwin, and who knows how many of my fellow comrades. Madam Death had been here, and she had listened to me. There is a saying in Leilen that a man is not done being created until the day he is dead, I knew then, I understood what I had to do. I ripped opened the regalia sack and took what I needed, I had lost my sword and shield while I was running away, but now I was not running away anymore, I was running into battle. The regalia was a mix of polished black and silver steel with deep engravings that I did not understand. I put on most of the armor, what fit me anyways, and I grabbed the bronze maul that was inside, a Warhammer would be a better description. I had never trained with a hammer in my life, but when I picked it up, it felt like I was born to wield it.\r\n\r\nI turned back and walked into the sandstorm, I went searching for the sandghosts that had killed Bellwin and Loric, I wanted to crush their heads under the weight of my hammer, I wanted to feel their bones break and their blood paint the sand red. I soon found one of them, I swung my hammer and shattered his scimitar in a thousand pieces, he looked at me like a frightened deer before I pierced the front of his skull with the back of my hammer, blood spilled and I felt the grace of Madam Death fell upon me. More sandghosts followed, and more bodies piled behind me. I was sworn in steel and pledged for revenge. I kept marching, swinging my hammer at anything that moved, I swung it hard, and I swung it fast, each time that my hammer struck true I felt a raging pleasure fill my heart. I marched on and I crushed every single body that crossed my path, I was never hurt, not a single scimitar cut my skin, not a single arrow pierced my cloth.\r\n\r\nI only stopped when I saw the brigadier’s eyes looking back at me from behind his shattered skull. I had bludgeoned his head so hard that his skin stuck to the hammerhead and I had to pick the pieces away one by one. It was not only Batista, but half of the sandghost I thought I had killed, were the members of my own unit. The brigadier didn’t even lift his sword against me. He thought I was there to help him. I didn’t even see him until I had to clean his brain from my weapon. I thought about stopping, but I hadn’t found the sandghost who killed Bellwin, that was all I cared about, Bellwin was only there because of me, and I had promised, I had sworn to protect him, and I didn’t. Worse yet, I fled as soon as I had the chance. A shandghost had slit Bellwin’s throat and all I did was take away his prized sack of loot and run away like the coward I was.\r\n\r\nLeilen was the idyllic past that I never lived but that I remembered, but Bellwin, he was the brother I never met, he was the laughter of my childhood, he was my past and he could have been my future. I heard the silence fall upon the red battlefield and felt scared. I wanted to be with Bellwin, I wanted to meet him and hold him once again. I cried to the heavens and I begged for death. When I went back searching for him, I saw him in all of them. Every single one of them wore his face, they all had his dark hair, all their eyes gleaned with the same green hue. I encountered a hundred Bellwins, a hundred mirror images of his warm corpse. I ran into each one of them, looking for deliverance but no one would embrace me. They all rejected me, lashed back with their swords, poles and daggers, and I killed all of them in turn, each one of them. I killed Bellwin a hundred times, and a hunred times I mourned him. A hundred times I lunged myself at Death, and a hundred times she rejected me that day. It was her reward for becoming her avatar in this world.\r\n\r\nAt some point, when the bodies ran out, the fighting stopped and I stopped seeing him. I couldn’t find him anymore. It was then when I realized I had lost Bellwin forever. Once the sandstorm finally stopped, I turned back and walked again into the sandhills. I don’t remember much of what happened after. I suppose you must have captured me a few days later, I would have died from thirst otherwise.\r\n\r\nUntil the day I find you again, I will feed my revenge\r\nUntil my heart stops, every breath of mine is yours",

He was raised in a village with no name, near the barely-named town of Tuygi. His mother was an underrated seamstress, and his father died in a pointless war when he was 10. Though, none of these things were really out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nThose things weren’t what interested me in Codigo. It was the way he’d just sit and watch a stream for hours on end, observing the ripples and eddies form and disperse over and over in different ways each time. Or how he would look at the sky and smell the air, and know to take the long road around the canyon before it started to rain and flood. Most of all, it was when he first picked up that bag, and started noticing ME.\r\n\r\nSo I called to him. It was time we had chat.\r\n\r\nI was compelled to act. The first couple of weeks with the bag, I would rush home from my journeyman post with the smith, and pull out the Warhammer from the bag to go patrol the road to Tuygi from town. My old fear of the bandits and ghouls that would take to the road through the forest, was replaced with a sense of purpose. Now they had something to fear.\r\n\r\nOn my eighth night patrolling the road, I noticed it. I was resting at my fire when a squat ghoul tried sneaking up on me, but I heard his clumsy approach. Just before he could reach me, I spun and launched my Warhammer towards the sky and through his face. As the life was leaving the ghoul, I felt it. It was as if I was being watched, but from all directions. As if the air noticed what I just did. Not a sense of judgement, but a sense of knowing. It was unsettling and invigorating all at once. What was IT?\r\n\r\nI kept to my nightly patrols, with my senses tuned to suss out this strange force. I would feel it now and again. When I would escort a lost merchant to safety, or find a group of bandits that hadn’t gotten the message that this road isn’t safe them.\r\n\r\nA collapsed into my bed after a patrol one night. That’s when it called to me. I didn’t dream, but had a vision. I saw the entirety of my world enveloped and connected by raw energy of power and light coalescing into a single point. It looked like an hourglass, but instead of sand it was the world’s EXPERIENCE funneling into a single point. Every action was contained and observed. At the bottom of the hourglass was a vast temple, absorbing the energy. It was the most glorious sight I’ve ever seen.\r\n\r\nmultiverse-rift\r\nmultiverse-rift\r\n1024×1024 90.8 KB\r\nJust as quickly as the vision came, it left. I woke up shaking in bed, skin colder than the Ik Nupay mountains. Mom was there to comforting me. She was trying to hide it, but I could tell she was frightened.\r\n\r\nI barely had the energy to say, “I’m sorry, I have to go find it.”\r\n\r\n“Find what?!” She cried.\r\n\r\n“The Rift.”\r\n\r\nI left home 40 or 42 days ago. I can’t really remember. I didn’t exactly know which way to go. It was more of a feeling. That feeling took me northwest, away from the sea and in to the desert. Every time I slept, I would search for this place, this rift, but I found nothing. All I had to go on, was the feeling that I was closer.\r\n\r\nNow I was fully in the grasp of the desert. I only had provisions for twelve days when I entered it, and this was my ninth day of hiking into its heart. Had I really just walked my way into my own death? Maybe this bag is just a curse, and the exact same thing happened to the unfortunate that found it before me!\r\n\r\nNight was falling, and I was exhausted. I reserved most of my travel for the night time, as I figured it was safer to sleep during the day, but the warm night was too much for my beaten body to resist. I laid down on my bedroll, and began to close my eyes. Then on the horizon I saw a faint glow! I just laid there and looked at it for a few minutes, partially to soak in what I was seeing and partially to make sure I wasn’t seeing things. I finally got up, I didn’t bother packing up my little campsite. I just grabbed my bag, and walked towards the light.\r\n\r\nI walked the entire night, as the glow took up more and more of the horizon. When the sun rose, I saw what looked like a structure miles away. It was real! I increased my pace, but was certain I couldn’t keep it up much longer.\r\n\r\nBy dawn, I had arrived at the Rift.\r\n\r\nI saw a large stone temple with light emanating from the top. Or was the light coming in? It had long, seemingly endless, steps going up to its entrance. The stone was etched with what looked like hundreds of different languages, including common tongue. It read, “…ENTER AND KNOW AND ENTER AND…” repeating over and over.\r\n\r\nrift_entrance\r\nrift_entrance\r\n1024×1024 180 KB\r\nI walked towards the steps, and placed my foot on the first one. Next thing I knew I was inside of the temple. I stood at an elevated doorway. In front of me was an atrium, the light was flowing from above and concentrating in the center of the space. Behind me was a long hallway that led to the temple entrance, at least I assumed judging by the desert beyond. Surrounding the atrium were dozens of similar doorways connected to similar hallways, but there wasn’t desert beyond those hallways. The few that I caught a glimpse of, each led to a different looking place. And yet, that was barely an afterthought compared to that light. I stepped towards it.\r\n\r\nrift-atrium\r\nrift-atrium\r\n1024×1024 174 KB\r\nJust as I had decided to step towards it, it began to amass at the center of the atrium. It started to take shape, to form into something. The light stopped flowing from the sky, and the shape before me formed into a large hooded being. I dropped my bag, I was petrified! Not because the being looked frightening, but because I had never felt the presence of pure power. Instead of a face, the hood contained eternity.\r\n\r\nThis is what brought me here.\r\n\r\nrift-oracle\r\nrift-oracle\r\n1280×768 63.1 KB\r\n“HELLO CODIGO SIMIAN,” it whispered like rolling thunder. I didn’t hear the words, they just echoed through my mind.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” I wasn’t surprised it knew who I was.\r\n\r\n“I AM THE RIFT,” it spoke in my head.\r\n\r\n“Isn’t this place the Rift?” I thought.\r\n\r\nThe Rift echoed, “WE ARE ONE. WE ARE THE NEXUS OF EXPERIENCE. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND SEE”\r\n\r\nI thought back to my vision those many nights ago. The entirety of the world’s actions and experiences condensed to a single point, this very place. The vision in my mind’s eye started shifting and evolving, I was no longer in control. The condensed world expanded in every direction, taking up the entirety of my vision. I was high up over the earth, I could see faraway lands in every direction…it’s so big. I flew close towards the earth and floated over a landscape. In the horizon to the east I saw the sea and my village. Across the horizon to the west were rolling hills dotted with other villages, and in the far west were the dead lands. Connecting all of it, was the same glowing energy that created the Rift. The villagers tilling their land caused the light to glow a little brighter over them. A pair of adventurers fighting the ghouls from the dead lands had even more light over them. And brightest of all was the light coming from the top of the craggily mountain.\r\n\r\nThe vision began to morph again, the sun began to rise and fall over the landscape faster and faster. Time was accelerating! I could see the light over the pair of adventurers split, they went their separate ways. The first one went back to one of the villages and stayed there for years, their light grew only a little over that time. The other seemingly sought out the energy. They grew their light by venturing into crypts and caverns, and patrolling the roads just as I had! Eventually, their light was the brightest one I could see. Then the light over the mountain stirred, and out burst a red dragon flying straight towards the adventurer…\r\n\r\nIt all made sense now! The whole world is connected through its experience! That experience is power that anyone can harness. I just have to seek it out.\r\n\r\nThat’s when I opened my eyes, and I was back home in bed. It was daybreak. I stood up, grabbed my bag, and stepped outside. I saw the light. Now my adventure can begin.",
    "\r\nGenesis Scrolls Round 1: {Adventure interrupted}\r\nWriting\r\nopen-quill\r\nMay 2022\r\nMay 2022\r\n\r\nandre\r\nMay '22\r\n“On deck!” shouted the captain in a gravelly voice as the roar of thunder covered the call.\r\n\r\nHis left hand wiped the water from his face, while his right held a firm grip on the ship’s wheel. He could barely see amid the torrential rains and briny waves that crashed over the ship rail.\r\n\r\nThe night was dark and the stars were hidden behind thick clouds. The frequent cracks of lightning provided only intermittent light. But that is enough. The captain forsaw a wall of water in a giant swell ahead of the ship. The captain heaved on the ship’s wheel spinning it violently, and brought the ironwood galleon about in parallel with the mountain of water. The briny mountain swelled further before cresting just off the bow of the ship. The top would clear the mast by a good five or six feet.\r\n\r\n“And now we test the quality of these ironwoods…” grumbled the captain to himself.\r\n\r\n“Did you say something boss?” - Screamed the first mate to his left, holding himself steady with rope. The crew knew what Captain Yageter was aimed to do. The ship was staring straight into the mouth of the giant crescent wave. The Captain stopped the wheel and guided his ship in. In a few moments, they had entered fully and water crashed right over top, crashing into the starboard sea.\r\n\r\n“Hold tight.” shouted the captain in warning. The crew are entirely at the mercy of this daring captain, and he needs every bit of their obedience. And their optimism.\r\n\r\nThe Temkyran Kraken Moon ship hadn’t been tested like this before. Although captain Yagheter trusted his shipwright, shipyards weren’t a real test of a vessel. It had been months since he had abandoned his old ship, the Kraken Grasp, for this one. She had larger quarters for more crew and a much larger hold. He’d even abandoned the Sigil of the Whale in favor of the Kraken. The captain hoped this quest was worth the scorn he drew from his family. Up until this moment, that had been the case. But even the confident captain worried about the weight of the riches in her hold from their first plunder in the Dragon Lands.\r\n\r\n“If we get through this storm, I promise I’ll never touch a bottle of rum again!” a shipmate screamed amidst the crashing water. The sailor was atop the crow’s nest, close enough to stick his hand into the wave just above him. The crow’s nest swung wildly while the mast bowed under the strain of the wind and the swales.\r\n\r\n“If we get through this one, I’ll drink your share of rum myself!” The first mate yelled to the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Promise or not, you won’t last long up there!”\r\n\r\nThe wave broke early, as the captain feared and sucked the sailor in the crows nest into the rolling black sea. No one saw him after that. The Captain reefed on the ship’s wheel and brought the ship in line with the wave and surfed out the far side with stunning speed. The Temykan was out of peril for the moment, but she still had tumultuous waters ahead.\r\n\r\nThe first mate laughed, no other response seems warranted. Cynicism has always been the motto of Yagheter’s crew.\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t the crew’s first storm. Seafarers all of them. Warriors of the sea.\r\n\r\nSwhaaaaaash!\r\n\r\nAnother wave broke over the ship, and took the feet out from under half a dozen sailors. The water on deck tossed the sailors around like spiders in a rainstorm.\r\n\r\nThe Temykran groaned and pitched on her side but held strong. The Ironwood had proved quite resilient so far in the onslaught.\r\n\r\n“The North can’t be overcome so easily”, the Captain gloated to himself through clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nThe rain fell in sheets across the Temykran while ice cold water slammed the ship sides. All manner of cargo sloshed and broke in the frigid brine on deck.\r\n\r\n“If you get us out of this captain, we’ll fight for you for eternity!\"\r\n\r\n“Ready lads! The end of this tempest is nigh.”\r\n\r\nThe Captain cupped around his mouth.\r\n\r\n“No storm, magic or not, can last forever!”\r\n\r\nEven in the teeth of death, the Captain roused his men. Ice tipped his beard and a gold tooth reflected the lightning when it cracked.\r\n\r\nThe captain turned his voice over his shoulder and yelled again in exasperation.\r\n\r\n“Pinky, DID YOU FIND the parchment!?”\r\n\r\nSLAM!\r\n\r\nPinky’s slippered foot kicks open the Ironwood door behind the helm that leads to the captain’s quarters. The white-bearded, white-haired mess of a mage stepped up onto the deck. Water hit his divine robes, beaded off and fell to the planks leaving the old Mage to cast a spell.\r\n\r\nThe captain grabbed an empty mug reached down to his ankles and scooped a cup of the cold sea. He turned and tossed it right into Pinky’s face. \r\n“For good luck Pinky! And also to sober you up. Haha!” The Captain laughed, unsure if the second part was even possible.\r\n\r\n“It was time! I thought we’d be seeing mermaids walk before you showed up Pinky. \" shouts the captain with a hint of relief amid an otherwise cocksure and confident smile. \r\n\r\n“Luck has nothing to do with it, Captain. But I shall return the favour.” He laughed and wiped the water from his face. \r\nThe mage recited his incantation, but neither the captain nor crew understand the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe rain cowered to a drizzle, and the clouds gave way to the night sky. Stars twinkled above and the moon cast a peaceful light on a soothing sea. The celestial illuminations turned the ice-encrusted Temykran into a sparkling dream. The ironwood girl has done well, and she coasted gently on the sea as if guided by a divine hand. The captain tips his hat to the white mage. Pinky nodded in acceptance, but tapped at his temples to remind the Captain, he’d not soon forget the mug of brine.\r\n\r\n“It was a light magic storm, easy to defeat.” Pinky said loudly. He strained to stand upright, not from the rolling seas, but the rum rolling through him. “Now, to matters of great import. When I find the wind scroll you found in the Dragon Lands I’ll be able to land us on the treasure isle of Nlenretel by moonfall. Till then just follow the northern star.”\r\n\r\nHaving made what he thought to be a suitable enough declaration of course for the bosun, the bearded old bastard slowly bent down, picked up a bottle of rum from the floor, gripped the cork with his teeth, pulled it out with a sharp swipe and spit it ahead:\r\n\r\n“I think my share of the treasure just increased AT least 20%.” says the wizard with the smile of who knows he has solved an unquantifiable problem as he calmly reenters the door he had left.\r\n\r\n“We’ve been going through the volumes without rest, you lazy drunk bastard, we’ll find it.” jokes the captain while Pinky goes away. Pinky, the captain and the crew have been going through their plunder since they left the dragon lands.\r\n\r\nThe cache of books and tomes was more than his crew had read in their lifetimes combined. Which was fine, they much preferred the gold and gemstones they’d taken over a trove of dusty old books. Even though she lay low with gold, the Captain hadn’t found his prize yet.\r\n\r\n“It’s on Nlenretel, I know it.” Determined eyes scan the sea before him.\r\n\r\n“BOYS, back to looking! Pair off with one who can read and search those books.”\r\nThe Captain hollers at his crew,\r\n\r\n“You find that wind spell for ole Pinky here, and every last bit of treasure in the hold is yours.” Cheers erupt from the crew as the promise of fortune warms their cold limbs. A buzz flows through them as they head below deck to search the crates of books.\r\n\r\n“We’ll get that scroll for ya, you obsessed crazy bastard!! ” shouts the captain towards the door his old friend Pinky entered.\r\n\r\n“We’ll make it there anyway, Captain, scroll or not.” shouted someone in the crew encouraging the captain.\r\n\r\n“Aye, maybe. But ‘er since I heard those lads talking about it I’ve been after this Loot. It’s real, Pinky.” Whispered the captain\r\n\r\n“A genesis bag. Probably the last one.” Turning his eye to the sea, steadfast in his mission, the Captain pondered on.\r\n\r\n“And I want it now.”",

It’s time to go for a walk.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~ Eve of the 7th day of Icewhile\r\nEveryone I spoke to today seemed to know someone, or know someone who knows someone who’s been abducted. Never to be seen again.\r\n\r\nHer twisted abominations still terrorise the town. Remnants of her foul, unholy army. I remember the fear they wrought. The souls she tarnished… No wonder the town can’t move on. The heroes came, but clearly they didn’t clean up.\r\n\r\nThe officials told me no one knows how or why her chimeras still roam. Why they only come out at night. Where they come from, or where they go.\r\n\r\nThey told me whenever one had been abolished, another takes its place…\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nThey told me they just keep the job pasted up on the board.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~ Eve of the 8th day of Icewhile\r\nThird night and so far, I’ve encountered nothing.\r\n\r\nThe nights have been still, and silent if you don’t count the groans and cracks from the sewage below. That rotting stench… I swear, I could taste it on my tongue.\r\n\r\nI saw limp, disembodied hands still hanging off railings. Splintered bones lay between the cobbles and deep red blood stains the streets like she stains their memories. Not years of rain could wash away the remains of her reign.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nThey tell me the last incident was seven nights ago. Maybe tonight is my lucky night…\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~ Eve of the 9th day of Icewhile\r\nToday I met another traveller. A witch. But refreshing nonetheless. She was on her own quest, in search of the Grave Wand.\r\n\r\nAnother necromancer, looking for the wand that took millions of souls. The wand that raised entire battalions. The wand responsible for these rotten remains of a town… She told me that the Queen’s corpse was never found in the ruins.\r\n\r\nThe witch also told me that like most witches, the Queen was conceived from ritual, but unlike most witches, conceived with demonic blood. She told me that she wasn’t born into royalty. That she stole the life of a Princess. Along with her name. Violette…\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the witch’s story doesn’t surprise me. A real Queen wouldn’t do this to her own, even if they were a witch… But a demon?\r\n\r\nI told her it’s not been as bad since Violette’s reign ended, but I still spend most my days cleaning up after necromancers. The irresponsible ones, the reckless ones, the mad ones. I told her stories of their tests of power, their corrupted experiments, their loss of control. I told her my Tome is usually all it takes to clean up - I told her there’s not many ways to kill something that’s already dead, but it seems these books really pack a punch.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nI hope she heeds my warning.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~ Eve of the 10th day of Icewhile\r\nI bumped into the witch again this morning. I never thought I’d see the day a witch and an inquisitor get on. I guess in this town, I’d take any pleasantries I can get. We ate bread, shared leads, rumours, myths…\r\n\r\nShe said some folks swear the Queen’s still alive, they say her corpse was never found. Some reckon her corpse wouldn’t be found because Death took her personally.\r\n\r\nI told her others seem convinced another has already claimed the wand. They reckon the wand corrupts, and the abductions won’t stop until it’s destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe witch said whoever might claim it, won’t necessarily have the demonic talent to turn the dead like Violette did.\r\n\r\nShe even told me she met a group of children who told her people only get abducted if you misbehave.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nIs this how myths are born? Suffering, tyranny, death… distilled into cautionary tales… in order to get children to behave?\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~ Morn of the 10th day of Icewhile\r\nI saw it! My hands tremble as I write this. This one was different.\r\n\r\nStill, a concoction of limbs. Limbs grafted together. Limbs from corpses of monsters and men. Twisted and contorted. But…\r\n\r\nIt moved too fast. Much faster than the ones I remember. And with purpose. Intention.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t abolish it.\r\n\r\nThis one was different. But, familiar. Something more sinister.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nSomething more… sophisticated.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~ Eve of the 11th day of Icewhile\r\nThey told me a child was abducted last night. I reported what I saw.\r\n\r\nI told them I hadn’t faced her abominations in years but this was not a remnant of her army. It was different. But still… Familiar. I asked them straight up - is she really dead? Other necromancers don’t twist and graft like the Queen. They aren’t capable.\r\n\r\nThey couldn’t answer. They admitted they never found her corpse in the rubble. But no one in all the realms have reported seeing her since the tower was toppled. They said they’ve searched the town. They told me there’s only one known way out of this town and no one’s ever reported her leaving…\r\n\r\nI know this town smells of rot, but something smells off here.\r\n\r\nI searched all over for the witch today, but I couldn’t find her. I was to demand a séance - if the Queen is dead, a witch would be able to contact her, right?\r\n\r\nThe mood in town was even more sullen today. Everyone knows, but no one’s talking about it. Only the parents are searching, knowing they’ll never find her.\r\n\r\nI understand the demoralisation, the unwillingness to move on from the past. The bones in the street. For this town, the terror never really stopped. For the rest of the realms, the tower falling felt achievement enough, I suppose…\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\nWell, the sun’s waning. The streets are empty. It’s time to go for a walk. My Tome, and I.\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n~\r\n\r\n}",

It might seem odd to you humans why Klag was knuckle-deep in nose juice, but cheese plugs were quite common in the Kobold community. You’d use cheese plugs too if you lived so close to a lava field. To be frank, Klag preferred a mild block of cheddar but had opted for the more pungent Stilton this morning because he had to traverse the putrid Froegunn Pass. Unfortunately, not only did this route cut through lava fields, it also took travelers dangerously close to what the human’s called the Landing of the Twins. Klag, however, preferred it’s more colorful Kobold name, the “Stink Pan.” That place smelled like month-old goat excrement.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the cheese was pretty jammed in there, so he withdrew his middle digit, sighed, and looked out back toward the direction he came. Far below Klag was home, a comfortable, dank little cave, likely filled at this hour with the yelps of his 17 dear pups, frantically wrestling for seats near the dinner table. He imagined his love, Buksug, barking her favorite melody as she filled the children’s bowls with her famous beetle sludge stew. He swore he could hear her piercing howls two days journey up the mountain. He turned and scanned upward. The Red Rim Mountains were known to all Koboldkind as a place to avoid. Terrible creatures roamed the pass and the volcanic heat exhausted even the most energetic traveler. Klag sighed again, drew a skeletal fishhead from his sack and did what he always does in these situations, he conversed with Fishy.\r\n\r\n“Fishy, we are sure in a mess. Remember Guzhok and Zurga? They made the best Beetle Mead. They were the last two that went this way, and they never came back.”\r\n\r\nIf Fishy did remember Guzhok and Zurga, it didn’t say. It’s eye holes stared back blankly; perhaps the memory was too painful.\r\n\r\n“You’re right, I’m being paranoid – I shouldn’t think that way. Maybe there are juicier beetles out east and they decided to stay? Probably living like chieftains somewhere. If anyone could make it, those two could.”\r\n\r\nFishy, seemed skeptical.\r\n\r\n“Don’t give me that, you know I don’t have a choice,” Klag snapped. “Everyone knows that champions of the Gelatinous Slime cook-off are granted the ‘honor’ of representing our clan at the Great Kobold Cooking Challenge each spring. I don’t think it’s an accident that the path to the challenge always just happens to take us through literally the most dangerous place in the entire country. No wonder Broopslug is undefeated ten years running.”\r\n\r\nFishy’s vacant stare sparked Klag.\r\n\r\n“Fine, you’re right. I could have thrown the competition. You try to just abandon your dreams. I am a great baker, and you know it,” bellowed Klag as he pointed critically at Fishy then slammed his fist down.\r\n\r\nFuming, Klag marched to the other side of the rock outcropping and unbundled his pack to fetch his sleeping bag and the mushrooms he foraged on the way up the mountain. He was pretty sure they were Sillweed mushrooms and not the psychedelic Dragonfangs. Too enraged to care at this point he popped them into his mouth and unfolded the sack; Not only was he hungry, but he also had a migraine from his argument with Fishy and the mass of cheese blocking his right nostril. He went to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that kobolds hate daylight – well, they hate a lot of things, but daylight is in the top 10% of all hated things. Most believe it has to do with their vision being better at night; this, however, was just what they tell outsiders. The truth is that most kobolds are narcissistic and will do just about anything to keep their skin looking young and pale. You can imagine, then, how moody Klag was after rolling down the mountain for the tenth time. Unable to sleep, he reluctantly rose, gathered his belongings, including Fishy, though they were not yet on speaking terms, and continued toward the pass.\r\n\r\nSome hours later, just as the sun was beginning to set, Klag began to daydream. He thought back to the time he made that magnificent spider egg short bread for the wedding of Goblin Warlord, Stone Tooth the Wretched. Those buttery biscuits were so delightful and so filling that Stone Tooth called off the human sacrifices for over a week. The short bread was the talk of the entire town. A sudden and loud “crunch” snapped Klag out of his dream. He looked down and saw that his foot had impaled the chest of a decapitated humanoid creature. Panicked, Klag tried to dislodge himself from the creature’s chest cavity but instead, tripped and fell forward into a pile of disemboweled human flesh. Quickly, Klag scrambled from the heap and frantically began wiping the unidentified human goop from his body. Finally, he scanned the scene.\r\n\r\nKlag didn’t realize that the mountain path had started to level out. The sweet memory of that delicious short bread had distracted him just enough that he failed to realize he stood in the Landing of the Twins. The landscape was violent and stark. Lava pools bubbled in the distance and jagged igneous columns peppered the terrain. Juxtaposed starkly against the greys of the mountain was gruesome carnage. Human body parts were indiscriminately strewn about, an arm here, a leg there, and so on.\r\n\r\n“Gross,” exclaimed Klag as he covered Fishy’s eyes. He swiftly covered his mouth. Whatever had torn these humans apart must still be close by. He must stay quiet.\r\n\r\nHe spotted a carriage that was still intact and tiptoed his way across the battlefield to get a better look. Maybe whatever devil slaughtered these humans had moved on, thought Klag. No beast could stand the smell of humans for long…and they tasted awful.\r\n\r\nThe carriage seemed to be well-built, not a standard design. There were intricate markings on its sides and the wheels were sturdy and custom-made. Klag couldn’t exactly tell but the scatterings of horse bits indicated that these weren’t just working horses, they were the noble stallions. Curious, Klag peered into the carriage. Nestled among padded seats and fine leathers were several boxes and what looked like a breadbasket. Klag couldn’t resist; he was, after all, a sucker for royal breads and pastries. I bet it is a sourdough, thought Klag as he licked his lips and pulled the basket out.\r\n\r\nIt’s heavy , thought Klag, but he dared not look yet. All these human guts everywhere would spoil the meal; he would enjoy it later when there was a little less death. He took the basket under his arm and tiptoed back the way he came.\r\n\r\nHe had nearly made it away from the landing when he spotted an unusual human carcass. This one still had its metal skin on, and a giant hammer lay beside it. Klag had never seen such fancy equipment before, and his curiosity once again got the better of him. He approached.\r\n\r\nThe human was certainly dead but a little less ravaged than the others. Maybe whatever beast had killed them couldn’t get through this human’s thick plates. Klag flipped open its full helm: “uuuuugly,” he frowned, “no wonder the monster didn’t eat this one.” Most of the equipment was too large for Klag but the warrior wore a silver-looking ring and carried an amulet that would be easy to carry. He won’t need these things, thought Klag, and he pried both jewelry pieces from the corpse. The ring fit well enough on Klag’s thumb. He stared at it momentarily and for a second, he thought he saw it shimmer a supernatural light.\r\n\r\n“Did you see that, Fishy?” whispered Klag. “These human things are so peculiar.” He shrugged and got up, a bit too clumsily as he accidentally kicked the breadbasket.\r\n\r\n“Waaaaaaaa,” croaked the basket, quietly at first then louder.\r\n\r\n“Fishy, I’m not so sure that is a breadbasket,” Klag breathed, irritated. Shhhh, shhhhh, shhhhh, Klag shushed and quickly opened the lid; instead of the bewitching aroma of fresh sourdough, Klag was affronted with the noxious whiff of sour human. The baby’s cries turned to shrieks.\r\n\r\nOn cue, a significantly louder screech pierced the evening the sky. In the distance, a beast stirred and the ground quaked as it began lumbering toward Klag’s position.\r\n\r\n“Eeeeek,” squealed Klag. He paused for a second, looked at the human, shook his head, and then high-tailed it. He located an outcropping of rocks a short distance away and dove behind it. As the beast rounded a chasm, Klag spotted the monster. It stood over 10 meters tall and was covered in coarse black and red hair; four massive legs propelled it forward countering its two upper limbs that ended with razor-sharp talons. A squat neck propped up a colossal, bear-like head. Signs of combat were also evident on the beast: at least a dozen arrows protruded from the behemoth’s back, a broadsword lay partly buried in its upper shoulder, and a variety of gashes were interspersed across its chest. The monster didn’t seem bothered and continued its way toward the child.\r\n\r\nAs it drew near, Klag realized the beast was distracted and there was an opportunity to make a break for it. Kobolds simply were not built for open conflict. They were crafty, not brave; best to leave the battling to the stouter species. At this moment, although every fiber in Klag’s being screamed “run,” he waited. He felt something strange, a knot in his belly and a fever to his pulse. It might have been those mushrooms – at this moment he was even less certain they were edible, but maybe it was something else? Perhaps insanity? Or maybe courage? That couldn’t be it, I’m probably stoned, thought Klag, who cares about that little human? They are awful anyway. Still, he continued to watch the beast and felt his grip tightening on Fishy.\r\n\r\nAn Important Aside\r\n\r\nIt is important that the reader understands how odd Klag’s behavior was at this point in the story. Perhaps a tale from Klag’s childhood will help?\r\n\r\nWhen Klag was just a wee kobold pup, he was charged with feeding the village chickens. Normally, he didn’t mind this task as it required almost no effort, but he always dreaded feeding the roosters. In particular, he feared a large rooster named Brzug. Well, Brzug was sort of a jerk and would peck anyone who got too close. One day after delivering the grain to the rest of the hens and less frightening roosters, Klag forgot to close the coop gate. Well, as expected old Brzug got loose and terrorized the community pecking the other kobolds frantically. No one in the village dared intercept the wild beast lest they lose an eyeball. Fortunately, from all that terrorizing, the rooster eventually grew sleepy and passed out in its pen. Klag’s three-year-old sister, Moogzug, was finally the one who locked Brzug back into the coop. Klag’s mother found Klag two days later hiding in a barrel down by the river. This was Klag’s modus oprandi right up until this moment on the mountain.\r\n\r\nBack to our Story\r\n\r\nSo there Klag was, meters away from a murder beast, contemplating something truly insane. Almost as if his body was acting on its own, he suddenly sprang toward the giant and launched a rock hitting it squarely in the nose. The monster blinked, wrinkled its face, and began to rise to its full height. The creature roared so deeply it threw Klag backward, luckily, it turns out, as its bladed hammer fists struck where he had just been, impaling the earth and severing the rocky wall that provided his cover. The dust provided temporary cover and Klag raced toward the large silver-skinned human. He began searching for a weapon but couldn’t find anything his size. The titanic hammer was the only equipment he could find. He grabbed the end of it, closed his eyes and lifted with all his might.\r\n\r\nTo his utter surprise, Klag raised the hammer as if it weighed the same as a small pot on his kitchen stove. Obviously, I am still drugged from the mushrooms, Klag thought, and he accepted that this was likely some strange hallucination; he charged the beast.\r\n\r\nThe razer talon was stuck in the rock outcropping and the monster didn’t see tiny Klag charging toward it. Unexpectedly, Klag tripped, and the hammer flung out of his grasp, miraculously toward the monster. It struck the side of the beast’s skull and caused it to topple over the rock wall and onto its back. Klag picked himself up and seeing the monster dazed grabbed the hammer again and leapt upon the beast. He struck again and again and again upon the monster’s belly until it ceased its movements. After several minutes of pummeling, Klag finally let go of the hammer. He slumped to the ground, now covered not only in human goop, but monster goop as well.\r\n\r\nFor ten minutes, Klag sat on the ground, his back against the pulverized monster, trying to understand what had just happened. He looked down at his bloodied hands and noticed again that faint light emanating from the ring. So odd, he thought as began to inspect it.\r\n\r\n“Waaaaaaaa,” the faint human cry came again back toward the landing.\r\n\r\n“I guess that thing survived somehow,” Klag exclaimed. He put the ring in his pocket and staggered toward the cries. The child was still in the basket. He peeked in and saw the creature’s grotesque dainty nose, putrid emerald eyes, and unsightly dimples. Disgusting, Klag thought to himself but for some reason he couldn’t just leave it. He took Fishy back out of his sack.\r\n\r\n“What do you think?” Asked Klag.\r\n\r\nFishy stared knowingly at Klag.\r\n\r\n“You think we should keep it?” queried the exasperated Klag? “Humans are the absolute worst. They smell, they’re ugly, their squishy skin gives me the heebie jeebies…”\r\n\r\nFishy again gave Klag the look.\r\n\r\n“I guess in a pinch we can eat it?” He took the child out of the basket and held it in front of him. The baby’s cries softened into a shallow whimpering, and it closed its eyes. “We are definitely eating this thing”. Talking about eating things made Klag hungry and he thought back to a delicious rye bread he made just before the journey. “We’ll call it ‘Rye’ for now, just in case, so there’s less confusion if we do decide to eat it.” He put the child back in the basket.\r\n\r\nWe must get out of here , thought Klag. That thing probably wasn’t the only fiend in this landing. Klag scoured the battlefield and eventually cobbled together a makeshift wagon. He figured the big silver human’s equipment was likely worth something, so he unbuckled the mesh belt, stripped its silver skin, grabbed the full helm, snatched the chain boots, and threw the leather gloves on for good measure. That’s probably all I can carry. He started to push the cart up the mountain path when he realized he forgot Rye. He went back, scooped up the basket and peeked in. Rye was asleep and without all the crying, didn’t seem quite so disgusting. Klag smiled and lightly set the baby onto the cart.\r\n\r\nThis was the weirdest mushroom trip I’ve ever had , thought Klag. He took Fishy back out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Remind me to tell you about my dream when I come to,” stated Klag.\r\n\r\nFishy didn’t want to alarm Klag so it remained silent. The best kind of heroes don’t know they are heroes at all.\r\n\r\nI hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights together with all associated claims and causes of action with respect to this work to the extent possible under the law.",

    "Realms - The Autonomous World 3/1/2023 by 🍞 Bibliotheca DAO has been building an eternal and ever-expanding onchain game world called the Realms. Realms - The Autonomous World Bibliotheca DAO has been building an eternal and ever-expanding onchain game world called the Realms. Examining the notion of Realms as an ‘Autonomous World’, we'll also reflect on Loot as the catalyst - the 'big bang' event that led us here. Loot may not be considered an onchain game in the traditional sense, but it has undoubtedly transformed the gaming landscape by introducing the concept of an open and composable world. Loot was the ‘big bang’ that created a new digital universe. Interlinked worlds are being built in that universe, like Realms, Banners and Hyperloot. Other worlds are being built in parallel universes, those that forked Loot, like DOPE DAO and Treasure DAO. As demonstrated by the amount of building, Loot was a moment of inspiration for a new generation of developers, who are eager to collaborate across the digital realm on a shared mission to build and expand the shared ‘Lootverse’. Loot transcends conventional notions, representing more of an abstract, creative idea that permeates culture. For just over 18 months, our contributors have been diligently developing, refining, and crafting an open-source vision for a CC0 permissionless world. Our concept has evolved from its initial focus on land ownership within the Lootverse to an autonomous, onchain world that operates independently. In retrospect, our ambitious design objectives for the DAO’s first game title, ‘Realms: Eternum’, were ahead of their time in 2021, rendering them unattainable at that juncture. Undeterred, we continue to forge ahead and build upon our progress. Tackling the hardest blockchain problems encouraged us to find and collaborate with the most talented problem solvers. We are proud to be at the heart of an uber talented, forward thinking blockchain development community.ghgerterttetyutyu4345 A game set in The Realms Autonomous World Realms was born out of the Loot phenomenon, carrying a distinct vision for a continually evolving, modular game that could flawlessly incorporate all Loot assets. The concept of \"Autonomous Worlds\" hadn't been coined at that time; instead, we initially referred to the idea for ‘Realms: Eternum’ (aka Eternum) as a Massively Multiplayer Online Onchain Composable Game (MMOCCG, yes LOL). Later on, we dubbed it the ‘Eternal Game’. However, none of these terms resonated as powerfully or evoked the same emotional response as \"Autonomous Worlds\" to describe the broader hyperstructure in which the game Eternum sits. We don't take the AW concept lightly; not every game is an Autonomous World (AW) – there is a spectrum. The chads at Lattice originally conceived the AW terminology, and we are embracing this shared meme as it provides a vivid depiction of what we have been building for a year and a half. From this point forward, we will retire our internal names (Eternal Games, MMOCCG) and refer to the project as, the Realms Autonomous World. ‘Realms: Eternum’ will be the first title launched in that world. Autonomous worlds bear a remarkable resemblance to blockchains in their nature. Once deployed, they endure, with their state persisting for the duration of the chain. Players can join or leave, and developers can build upon these worlds by deploying features in a permissionless way, akin to how contracts are deployed onto a chain. There is no universally accepted definition for an Autonomous World; however, our criteria for labeling a game as such requires at least these two essential features: Decentralized data availability layer: While the state execution may reside on a centralized layer, it is crucial that the state can be reconstructed if the execution layer ceases to exist. Rollups offer a solution, providing increased capacity execution layers while ensuring data is permanently settled on Ethereum. This guarantees the world's perpetual persistence. Permissionless entry point for expanding the world: The World contract must be capable of accepting new systems and components without requiring permission. While this doesn't imply that every component and system will be utilized, they must adhere to this pattern, ensuring open and unrestricted access for potential enhancements. Note: All Autonomous Worlds are onchain games. Not all onchain games are Autonomous Worlds. In our view, an onchain game becomes an AW when it can be expanded permissionlessly. This is just our interpretation and the heuristics we are following, but it is by no means cannonical. The open nature of an AW fosters the development of intriguing economic models, such as the \"Play to Die\" concept, which allows developers to compete at the application layer within the world akin to an app store. Autonomous worlds ought to be credibly neutral and not subject to central control by any group or individual. Be cautious of those who exploit the AW name for a quick profit in the future. Eternum's launch is not the end game for Realms or Loot; rather, it marks the beginning of a continuous evolution. It is our hope that in 10 years, Eternum will bear little resemblance to the game as it exists today, having grown and transformed over time. Where we started Our initial game design, conceived in 2021, was based on the diamond pattern and ran on Arbitrum. As we navigated the development process, we encountered various challenges and came to reason that the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Solidity were not as suitable as we would have liked for our World. As we investigated various options, Starknet emerged as the leading long-term solution due to its ability to abstract from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) while maintaining compatibility. Enthusiastically, we adopted Cairo and restructured the game using a Module Controller system, originally conceptualized by Perama for Dopewars. Implementing this modular controller pattern enabled the successful separation of security modules and state from the core logic. Nevertheless, we recognized that relying solely on this approach did not provide the necessary degree of abstraction for developers to build and extend the Autonomous World (AW) beyond Eternum, which has consistently been our primary design goal. It's important to acknowledge that numerous teams within Starknet have been advocating for autonomous worlds for quite some time, with notable implementations by Guilty Gyoza of Topology, the Influence team and Dope Wars RYO. Subjectively speaking, Starknet boasts the highest concentration of exceptional builders across the entire crypto universe, and with Cairo 1.0 beautiful abstraction it will continue to be. It is worth noting that the EVM ecosystem is undergoing rapid evolution. As a result, various shapes and forms of Autonomous Worlds (AWs) will emerge in many environments, EVM and Cairo VM. Our chosen path involves non-EVM but EVM compatibility with Starknet and Cairo as Cairo Virtual Machine provides interesting isomorphic approach to constructing verifiable compute. It is possible run the VM in WASM, custom app chains running Substrate or Starknet itself. There is a flourishing ecosystem emerging around WASM and Cairo, and we are at the heart of it. Enter Dojo The advent of MUD and the Lattices team adoption of an Entity-Component-System (ECS) pattern written in Solidity prompted us to reevaluate our approach to Eternum. In late November, the Realms team, together with Cartridge and Briq, started collaborating on a Cairo 1.0 onchain gaming toolchain called Dojo, heavily built upon the learnings of MUD. What is Dojo? Dojo is a dedicated Rust and Cairo 1.0 toolchain designed for terraforming Autonomous Worlds, bearing a close resemblance to MUD in terms of abstraction, albeit not an exact 1:1 match. Owing to the outstanding work accomplished by the Cairo 1.0 team, Dojo effectively eliminates much of the contract boilerplate associated with writing systems and components. All the work of structuring queries and mutating the world is consolidated into a set of easy to understand commands. Over the coming months tutorials on how these specifically work will be released for developers to build upon. Dojo's primary objective is to empower developers to begin building on Autonomous Worlds within a matter of hours, as opposed to months, thus expediting the onboarding process and promoting growth in the Realms Autonomous World and other AWs. By having worlds adhere to a common set of standards for components and systems, these elements can be efficiently shared across different worlds. This advantage doesn't even factor in the shared auditing, backend engineering, and other intricate work involved in constructing these worlds. Dojo is an open-source project looking for active contributors, if you love games, Rust or Cairo - join the discord. Eternum and Dojo While the Realms: Eternum Developer Alpha currently operates on a modular controller pattern, with an indexer and a web client for testing game features, we plan to migrate the game to the Dojo stack. This transition aims to enhance the development velocity and facilitate shared engineering resources, ultimately empowering developers to contribute more effectively to the world's expansion. While this transition might appear to be a significant shift, we already have most of the client design in place, so the primary focus will be on contract work in Cairo 1, from which we intended to migrate regardless. This highlights the beauty of onchain games – their headless nature! The ability to effortlessly swap out contracts and clients allows for flexibility and adaptability in a shapeshifting world. Eternum, aspires to endure alongside Ethereum itself. Its final form will inevitably differ from its current state, embodying the essence of an Autonomous World—unbridled, unconstrained, and permissionless.",
    "The Lordship Protocol 9/14/2024 by Secretive The Lordship Protocol is the core economic foundation of the Realms World. Today it is live and all legacy $Lords are unlocked for instant staking into the protocol. The Lordship Protocol The Lordship Protocol and the final 'legacy' $Lords unlock Introducing The Lordship Protocol and veLords The protocol has a bespoke architecture to promote the growth and alignment of the Realms World ecosystem. The system has been custom-built on Starknet by Realms contributors and is already receiving fees from game entries. You can read the details of the veLords system including voting power, emissions and early withdrawal penalties here.  What it means for protocol users A $Lords token holder can now stake their $Lords tokens into the Lords Protocol. They choose how long to lock their $Lords and in return receive a protocol emission reward rate, and veLords tokens. The protocol emissions are made up of a percentage of game fees and a percentage of marketplace fees. veLords tokens will have their own utility for governance of protocol emissions in an upcoming upgrade.  If you are a Realms NFT holder head to Realms.World Account Page now. You will be able to claim all L1 'legacy' $Lords from all three epochs of the galleon. There will be no more emissions unlocked on L1, all future claims are made on L2 for staked Realms NFTs that have been delegated for DAO governance. As of right now all $Lords emissions from staking are available.  What it means for the Realms ecosystem The introduction of veLords is part of the DAO's strategy to establish a fully onchain gaming ecosystem built by aligned but independent entities, like game studios, supported by a community and members.  $Lords locked for veLords will, in future updates, give the bearer the right to direct emissions from the DAO to scale successful games. This is phase one of rolling releases of the lordship protocol. This initial release focuses on funneling game fees. The following releases will include, LP fee capture within the system, Game incentives and a $Lords distribution mechanism.  Loot Survivor x veLords The first game to support veLords is Loot Survivor. A percentage of $Lords token used to play the game are sent to the veLords pool, and then split among participants in the Lordship Protocol. Studios aligned to the DAO will take a similar path, unlocking benefits for gamers, studio and protocol participants.  How to claim and stake Go to the accounts page on Realms.World and follow the instructions. You will need an L2 wallet for Starknet - both Argent and Braavos are supported. The longer you lock the more $Lords rewards and more voting power. There is a linear relationship between lock duration and protocol emissions. The contracts have been peer reviewed, and a member of the development team is by trade an auditor. The veLords contract to add to your Starknet wallet is:  0x47230028629128ac5bfbb384d32f925e70e329b624fc5d82e9c60f5746795cd  To review the Lords Tokenomics, click here.",

But it was always meant to be an exploration of a sort of thought experiment about community world building with the nfts being just the initial artifacts of that world as a starting point for others to build upon. They are purposefully designed to be minimalist and abstract to allow others to be inspired and fill in their own meaning for what they are, what the represent and the larger world that they are a part of. Part of this was making them radically open, explicitly releasing all possible copyrights. This created the cc0 (creative commons zero) NFT movement in which creators release their works with the goal being for others to steal them for whatever purposes they want to put them to. Since their release, a large community has formed around them. This community has treated the NFTs as a sort of archelogical discovery of artifacts from a fantasy world and has set about examining them to find patterns and any clues that yield information about the world to which they belong. That established a sort of baseline set of facts about the world. From there many set about filling in color for the world inventing stories and characters to fill out the world. So what loot really is, is an experiment in open, collaborative world building."
