But it was always meant to be an exploration of a sort of thought experiment about community world building with the nfts being just the initial artifacts of that world as a starting point for others to build upon. They are purposefully designed to be minimalist and abstract to allow others to be inspired and fill in their own meaning for what they are, what the represent and the larger world that they are a part of. Part of this was making them radically open, explicitly releasing all possible copyrights. This created the cc0 (creative commons zero) NFT movement in which creators release their works with the goal being for others to steal them for whatever purposes they want to put them to. Since their release, a large community has formed around them. This community has treated the NFTs as a sort of archelogical discovery of artifacts from a fantasy world and has set about examining them to find patterns and any clues that yield information about the world to which they belong. That established a sort of baseline set of facts about the world. From there many set about filling in color for the world inventing stories and characters to fill out the world. So what loot really is, is an experiment in open, collaborative world building."

          "text": "Loot nfts are called bags of loot. each bag contains mythical items of varying power that are sometimes associated with the different orders of the lootverse. over the eons these great and powerful items have been discovered and weilded by great adventurers. the power of the items over time results in catlaclysmic events, usually wars, that cause the destruction of societies and the scattering of the loot once again. the knowledge of them slowly fades or is purposefully forgotten until they slip into myth, legend and obscurity. the periods of time where the loot fades from the world are known as 'the mist.' inevaribly they are rediscovered and the cycle repeats. there are three great cycles that we know of: The Genesis Era, The Age of Exploration and the Age of Adventure (the cycle that we are currently in). As far as the physical world goes, a project called Realms has dedicated itself to mapping out the geography of the world. there are 7 major continents divided into 3 hemispheres with the various Orders of loot being endemically tied to the lands even through the many cycles of history"
